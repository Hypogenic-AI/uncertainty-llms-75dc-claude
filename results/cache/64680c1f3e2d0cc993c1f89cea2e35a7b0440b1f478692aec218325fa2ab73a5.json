Option 1 is correct: due to increasing resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended as first-line treatment for gonorrhea. Option 2 is incorrect because most fluoroquinolones are primarily renally excreted and require dose adjustment in renal failure. Option 3 is incorrect; fluoroquinolones are active against Pseudomonas (especially ciprofloxacin), and the statement about contraindication in neutropenic fever is not accurate.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
