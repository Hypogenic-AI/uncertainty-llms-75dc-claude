  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"McCune-Albright syndrome\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This case presents the classic triad of McCune-Albright syndrome: (1) caf\u00e9-au-lait spots (irregular brown macules), (2) precocious puberty (early breast development in a 7-year-old), and (3) fibrous dysplasia of bone (which causes hypophosphatemia due to renal phosphate wasting). The red striae and plethoric cheeks suggest Cushing's syndrome, which can occur in McCune-Albright due to autonomous adrenal hyperfunction. Paget's disease is incorrect as it occurs in elderly patients and doesn't explain precocious puberty or caf\u00e9-au-lait spots. Cushing's disease alone doesn't explain the caf\u00e9-au-lait spots or hypophosphatemia. Hypopituitarism would not cause precocious puberty.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
