  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Clinical Presentation:**\n- 3-year-old boy with fatigue and jaundice following URI\n- Splenomegaly (spleen tip 2 cm below costal margin)\n- Anemia (Hb 9.4 g/dL)\n- Elevated MCHC (39% - normal is 32-36%)\n- Negative Coombs test (rules out autoimmune hemolysis)\n\n**Key Diagnostic Features:**\nThe elevated MCHC is highly specific for hereditary spherocytosis. This occurs because spherocytes have decreased surface area relative to volume, making them more concentrated. The negative Coombs test rules out immune-mediated hemolysis, and the clinical picture (hemolytic anemia triggered by infection, splenomegaly) fits perfectly with hereditary spherocytosis.\n\n**Analysis of Complications:**\n\n0. **Acute myelogenous leukemia** - No association with hereditary spherocytosis\n1. **Cholecystitis** - Chronic hemolysis \u2192 increased bilirubin \u2192 pigmented gallstones \u2192 cholecystitis. This is a well-known complication of HS, though typically occurs later in life\n2. **Renal papillary necrosis** - Associated with sickle cell disease, not spherocytosis\n3. **Splenic sequestration crisis** - This is characteristic of sickle cell disease where abnormal RBCs get trapped in the spleen\n\n**Greatest Risk:**\nWhile cholecystitis from pigmented gallstones is the most common long-term complication of hereditary spherocytosis (occurring in 50-60% of patients), it typically develops later in childhood or adulthood due to chronic hemolysis and bilirubin overproduction.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Cholecystitis\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Hereditary spherocytosis (indicated by elevated MCHC, negative Coombs, hemolytic anemia) leads to chronic hemolysis and bilirubin overproduction, causing pigmented gallstone formation and subsequent cholecystitis",
