  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Clinical Presentation:**\n- Newborn with multiple congenital anomalies:\n  - Craniofacial: micrognathia, broad nasal bridge, short philtrum, small low-set ears, cleft palate\n  - Cardiac: systolic ejection murmur with echocardiography showing \"single overriding great vessel\" (suggestive of truncus arteriosus or similar conotruncal defect)\n\n**Key Diagnostic Consideration:**\nThis constellation of findings - particularly the combination of:\n1. Characteristic facial features (micrognathia, cleft palate, low-set ears)\n2. Conotruncal cardiac defect (truncus arteriosus)\n3. Broad nasal bridge\n\nThis is highly suggestive of **22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome/velocardiofacial syndrome)**.\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n0. **Low levels of parathyroid hormone** - This is a classic finding in DiGeorge syndrome due to parathyroid hypoplasia/aplasia, leading to hypocalcemia. This fits perfectly with the clinical picture.\n\n1. Double bubble sign - Associated with duodenal atresia (seen in Down syndrome, not this presentation)\n\n2. Chromosome 5p deletion - This is Cri-du-chat syndrome (cat-like cry, severe intellectual disability, different facial features)\n\n3. Bilateral cataracts - Not a typical feature of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome\n\n**Maternal History Note:**\nWhile lithium exposure in first trimester can cause Ebstein anomaly, the mother discontinued it at 5 weeks. The pattern here is more consistent with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which is typically a de novo genetic deletion.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Low levels of parathyroid hormone in serum\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"The combination of conotruncal cardiac defect, cleft palate, and characteristic facial features strongly suggests 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge).
