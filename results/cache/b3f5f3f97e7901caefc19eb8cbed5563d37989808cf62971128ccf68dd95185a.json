First-line pharmacotherapy for social anxiety disorder in adolescents is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) such as fluoxetine. Clomipramine (a TCA) and phenelzine (an MAOI) are not first-line due to side effect profiles and dietary restrictions. Propranolol is sometimes used for performance-only social anxiety, but not for generalized social anxiety as in this case.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
