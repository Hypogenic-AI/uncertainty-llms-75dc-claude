  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical scenario systematically:\n\n**Clinical Context:**\n- 40 weeks gestation, active labor\n- Epidural anesthesia just performed\n- Hypotension developed 10 minutes post-epidural\n- Patient is supine (implied by vertex at -1 station assessment)\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a standard, medically plausible obstetric scenario. The question describes a common complication of epidural anesthesia in labor.\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n**Option 0 - Sympathetic block:**\n- Epidural anesthesia blocks sympathetic nerve fibers\n- This causes vasodilation and venous pooling\n- Classic complication occurring within minutes of epidural placement\n- Timing (10 minutes post-epidural) is\u5178\u578b\n- Explains the hypotension pattern\n\n**Option 1 - Hypovolemia:**\n- No evidence of bleeding or fluid loss mentioned\n- Would expect tachycardia (pulse is normal at 68/min)\n- Less likely given the timing\n\n**Option 2 - Acute pulmonary hypertension:**\n- No clinical indicators (would expect respiratory distress, tachycardia)\n- Not associated with epidural anesthesia\n- Very unlikely\n\n**Option 3 - Aortocaval compression:**\n- Possible in supine position at term\n- However, this would be present before the epidural\n- The hypotension developed specifically AFTER epidural placement\n- While supine positioning may contribute, the temporal relationship points to the epidural as the primary cause\n\n**Key Distinguishing Factor:** The timing - hypotension occurring 10 minutes after epidural administration strongly suggests sympathetic blockade as the primary mechanism.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Sympathetic block\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Hypotension occurring 10 minutes after epidural anesthesia is classic for sympathetic blockade causing vasodilation. The temporal relationship between epidural placement and hypotension onset is the key diagnostic feature. While aortocaval compression can occur in supine pregnant patients, the specific timing after epidural makes sympathetic block the most likely primary cause.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
