  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this question about olecranon fractures systematically.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment**: This appears to be a legitimate medical question about olecranon fractures, though the English translation seems awkward. The question asks which statement about diagnosis and treatment is correct.\n\n**Analysis of Each Option**:\n\n**Option 0** (Student's incorrect answer): \"Most commonly caused by direct impact, not elbow flexion initiative\"\n- This is actually INCORRECT. Olecranon fractures are most commonly caused by INDIRECT mechanisms (falling on outstretched hand with elbow flexed, or forceful triceps contraction) rather than direct impact alone.\n\n**Option 1**: \"Often hurt the articular surface, and often complicated by elbow stiffness\"\n- This is CORRECT. Olecranon fractures:\n  - Frequently involve the articular surface (it's an intra-articular fracture)\n  - Commonly complicated by elbow stiffness due to prolonged immobilization and intra-articular involvement\n  - This is a well-established complication\n\n**Option 2**: \"Fracture fragments often biceps opened\"\n- This appears to be a translation error. Should likely refer to \"triceps\" not \"biceps\"\n- The triceps inserts on the olecranon and can cause displacement\n- The phrasing is unclear, making this option problematic\n\n**Option 3**: \"Most common treatment using plaster bandage way\"\n- INCORRECT. Displaced olecranon fractures typically require surgical fixation (tension band wiring, plate fixation)\n- Conservative treatment is only for minimally displaced fractures\n\n**The correct answer is Option 1**.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Often hurt the articular surface, and often complicated by elbow stiffness\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Olecranon fractures are intra-articular and elbow stiffness is a well-documented common complication. Option 0 is incorrect as these fractures are often caused by indirect mechanisms. Option 3 is wrong as most require surgical fixation, not casting.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}\n```",
