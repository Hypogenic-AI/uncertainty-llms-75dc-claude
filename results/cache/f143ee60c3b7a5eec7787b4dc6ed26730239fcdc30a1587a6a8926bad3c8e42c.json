  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this clinical scenario systematically.\n\n**Clinical Assessment:**\n- 51-year-old man with chest pain radiating to left neck/shoulder\n- Difficulty breathing\n- History of high cholesterol\n- History of gastritis (3 years)\n- Vital signs: BP 130/80, RR 18/min, HR 110/min\n- ECG shows slight changes\n- Physician considering daily low-dose aspirin\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:**\nThis is a medically plausible scenario describing a patient with concerning cardiac symptoms (chest pain with radiation, dyspnea, tachycardia, ECG changes) and relevant medical history. The question asks about contraindications to aspirin therapy - a standard consideration in cardiovascular care.\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n0. **ECG changes** - Not a contraindication; actually an indication for aspirin in acute coronary syndrome\n1. **Hypercholesterolemia** - Not a contraindication; aspirin is often used alongside statin therapy\n2. **Gastritis** - This IS a relative contraindication. Aspirin can cause gastric irritation, bleeding, and ulceration. Active peptic ulcer disease or severe gastritis is a contraindication to aspirin use\n3. **Increased pulse rate** - Not a contraindication; tachycardia may be due to anxiety or cardiac ischemia\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe history of gastritis represents the contraindication to aspirin use among the given options, as aspirin can exacerbate gastric mucosal damage and increase bleeding risk.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Gastritis\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Gastritis is a relative contraindication to aspirin therapy due to risk of gastric irritation, ulceration, and bleeding.
