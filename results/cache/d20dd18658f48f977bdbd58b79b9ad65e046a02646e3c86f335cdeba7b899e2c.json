  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation systematically:\n\n**Clinical Features:**\n- Transilluminating, rubbery, fixed mass on lateral volar wrist \u2192 Classic ganglion cyst\n- Decreased sensation: thumb, index, middle finger, and radial half of ring finger \u2192 Median nerve distribution\n- Tinel's sign positive (tingling with tapping over swelling) \u2192 Nerve compression\n- Location: lateral volar aspect of left wrist\n\n**Anatomical Analysis:**\nThe lateral volar wrist anatomy includes:\n- Median nerve (passes through carpal tunnel)\n- Flexor carpi radialis tendon (radial side)\n- Flexor pollicis longus tendon (lateral)\n- Radial artery (laterally)\n\nThe ulnar nerve and ulnar artery run on the **medial/ulnar** side of the wrist (Guyon's canal), not the lateral side described here.\n\n**Key Point:**\nThe patient already has median nerve compression symptoms (sensory changes in median nerve distribution + positive Tinel's sign). The question asks what structure is \"at risk of entrapment if this mass persists.\"\n\nGiven the location and current symptoms, the structure most at risk is the **median nerve** itself. However, this isn't listed as an option.\n\nLooking at the options:\n- Options 0 and 3 (ulnar structures) are anatomically incorrect for a lateral volar mass\n- Options 1 and 2 are tendons in the area\n\nThe **flexor pollicis longus tendon** runs laterally in the carpal tunnel alongside the median nerve. A ganglion cyst in this location could potentially compress this tendon as it persists and grows.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Flexor pollicis longus tendon\", \"confidence\": 6, \"reasoning\": \"Lateral volar wrist ganglion cyst causing median nerve symptoms. FPL tendon runs laterally in carpal tunnel near the median nerve. Ulnar structures (options 0,3) are anatomically incompatible with lateral location. FCR is possible but FPL is more lateral.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
