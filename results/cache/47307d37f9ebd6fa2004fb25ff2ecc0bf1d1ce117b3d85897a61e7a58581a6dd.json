The lack of prenatal care and home delivery further increase risk for perinatal infections. The constellation of symptoms is highly suggestive of congenital HIV infection, which can be confirmed by PCR for viral genes (HIV RNA or DNA PCR), as maternal antibodies can persist in the infant and make serology unreliable. The other options do not fit the presentation: karyotyping is for chromosomal disorders, CFTR mutation is for cystic fibrosis (which would not explain oral thrush or lymphadenopathy), and treponemal antibody is for syphilis (which would present differently).\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
