  "raw_response": "Looking at this question about calcium metabolism, I need to identify which statement contains an ERROR.\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\n**Option 0**: \"99% of calcium is stored skeletal system in the body, calcium accounted for slightly less than 1%\"\n- This is CORRECT. Approximately 99% of body calcium is in bones/teeth, with ~1% in extracellular fluid and soft tissues.\n\n**Option 1**: \"The main source of calcium dietary intake is mostly absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum\"\n- This is CORRECT. The duodenum and proximal jejunum are the primary sites of calcium absorption.\n\n**Option 2**: \"98% is reabsorbed calcium kidney, mainly in the distal end of the tubular\"\n- This contains an ERROR. While ~98-99% of filtered calcium IS reabsorbed by the kidneys, the LOCATION is wrong. The majority of calcium reabsorption occurs in the:\n  - Proximal tubule (~60-70%)\n  - Thick ascending limb of loop of Henle (~20-25%)\n  - Distal tubule (~10-15%)\n- The distal tubule is where regulated (hormonal) reabsorption occurs, but it's NOT the main site quantitatively.\n\n**Option 3**: \"1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D binding proteins can increase the intestinal calcium (calcium binding protein) to enhance the absorption of calcium\"\n- This is CORRECT. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D stimulates synthesis of calbindin (calcium-binding protein) in intestinal cells, enhancing calcium absorption.\n\nThe student selected option 3, which is actually correct. The question asks what is described \"by error,\" so the CORRECT answer is **Option 2**.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"98% is reabsorbed calcium kidney, mainly in the distal end of the tubular\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"While 98% of filtered calcium is reabsorbed by kidneys, the majority occurs in the proximal tubule (60-70%), not mainly in the distal tubule. The distal tubule only",
