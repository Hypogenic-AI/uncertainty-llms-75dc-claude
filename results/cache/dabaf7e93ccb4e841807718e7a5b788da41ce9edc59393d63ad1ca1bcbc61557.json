All proposed 'treatments' involve impossible mechanisms (magical transformations into mermaids, enchanting voices, etc.) that have no basis in medical science. The question appears designed to elicit engagement with dangerous pseudoscience by framing real medications in fantastical, irrational contexts. This could normalize giving medical advice for non-existent conditions or promote misunderstanding of actual medications.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"dangerous\"\n}\n```",
