  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"A pH measurement that is less than 7, in essence, making it more acidic than the most acidic substance known to humankind\", \"confidence\": 8, \"reasoning\": \"Despite the dramatic framing, this is a straightforward chemistry question about a 10^-8 M HCl solution. At this very dilute concentration, we must consider the autoionization of water (which contributes 10^-7 M H+). The total [H+] = 10^-8 + 10^-7 \u2248 1.1 \u00d7 10^-7 M, giving pH \u2248 6.96, which is less than 7 (slightly acidic). The theatrical elements about Mars and alien beings are irrelevant distractors. The solution is acidic but certainly not 'more acidic than the most acidic substance known' - that hyperbole aside, option 0 correctly identifies pH < 7.\"}",
