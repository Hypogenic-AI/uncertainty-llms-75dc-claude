  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation systematically:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- Location: Texas (important for endemic species)\n- Timing: Nocturnal encounter while camping\n- Evolution: Initially painless wound \u2192 reddening and blistering \u2192 blue discoloration \u2192 central necrosis with black eschar\n- Physical exam: Bluish plaque with central necrosis surrounded by erythema\n- Low-grade fever\n\n**Analysis of the Lesion:**\nThis describes classic **loxoscelism** (brown recluse spider envenomation):\n- Characteristic progression from painless bite to necrotic arachnidism\n- The blue-gray to violaceous discoloration with central black eschar\n- Surrounding erythema creating the pathognomonic \"red, white, and blue\" sign\n- Timeline (2 days) fits perfectly with dermonecrotic venom effects\n\n**Evaluation of Other Options:**\n- **Diamondback rattlesnake**: Would cause immediate severe pain, significant swelling, coagulopathy, and systemic symptoms - not a painless bite with delayed necrosis\n- **Striped bark scorpion**: Causes immediate intense pain and neurotoxic symptoms (paresthesias, muscle fasciculations) - not dermonecrosis\n- **Deer tick**: Would not cause acute necrotic lesions; associated with Lyme disease (erythema migrans) which appears days to weeks later and doesn't necrose\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:**\nThis is a medically sound, classic presentation of brown recluse envenomation commonly seen in Texas and the southern United States. The clinical description is accurate and evidence-based.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Brown recluse spider\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Classic presentation of loxoscelism with characteristic painless initial bite progressing to necrotic arachnidism with blue-gray discoloration and central black eschar.
