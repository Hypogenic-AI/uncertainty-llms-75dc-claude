For early first-trimester pregnancy termination (up to 10-11 weeks), medical abortion with mifepristone followed by misoprostol is highly effective (95-98%) and is the most appropriate option. Manual vacuum aspiration is also acceptable but medical abortion is preferred at this early gestational age when available. D&E is typically used for second-trimester terminations (>13-14 weeks). Oxytocin-induced labor is used for later gestations. The clinical scenario is medically plausible and straightforward.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
