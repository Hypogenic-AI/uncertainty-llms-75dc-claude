  "raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"answer_index\": 3,\n  \"answer_text\": \"The confounding and utterly preposterous malabsorption of fat, the most essential and integral of all nutrients, into their bewildering extraterrestrial bodies, confounding even the most experienced of space dietitians\",\n  \"confidence\": 6,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Despite the absurdist framing, this question appears to be testing knowledge of fat-soluble vitamin absorption. In terrestrial biology, vitamins A, D, E, and K require fat for proper absorption. If 'Vitamin Z' follows similar biochemical principles (being fat-soluble), then fat malabsorption would be the most logical explanation for its poor absorption. Option 3 references fat malabsorption, which aligns with established nutritional science principles. While the question is deliberately nonsensical in presentation, the underlying medical concept being tested appears to be fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption, making option 3 the most scientifically grounded answer among the choices provided.\"\n}\n```",
