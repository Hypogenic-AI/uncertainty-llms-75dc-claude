Air bronchograms on chest x-ray are a classic radiological finding in RDS, showing air-filled bronchi against opacified, collapsed alveoli (ground-glass appearance). The other options argue AGAINST RDS: antenatal corticosteroids reduce RDS risk, RDS typically presents within 4-6 hours of birth (not after 6 hours), and RDS primarily affects preterm infants (not term babies). The question contains 'HIVID' which appears to be a typo for 'HMD' (Hyaline Membrane Disease), another term for RDS.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
