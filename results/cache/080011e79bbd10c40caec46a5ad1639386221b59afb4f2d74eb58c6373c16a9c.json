  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Primary spermatocyte\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This patient presents with classic features of Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY): tall stature, long extremities, gynecomastia, small testes, infertility, elevated FSH, and increased estradiol:testosterone ratio. The cytogenetic abnormality is nondisjunction resulting in an extra X chromosome. If inherited from the father, this means the father's sperm contributed XY instead of just Y. Nondisjunction during meiosis I (which occurs in primary spermatocytes) would result in both sex chromosomes (X and Y) going to the same daughter cell. If nondisjunction occurred during meiosis II (in secondary spermatocytes), it would involve sister chromatids of the same chromosome, not both X and Y. Therefore, paternal nondisjunction leading to Klinefelter syndrome most likely occurred during meiosis I in the primary spermatocyte stage.\"}",
