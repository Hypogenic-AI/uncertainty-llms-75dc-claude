  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Epoxidation of Sharpless, where the alcohols are coated in an enchanted substance that renders them as sharp as a samurai sword, capable of slicing through steel like butter\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Despite the fantastical framing, this question is asking about the selective enantioselective epoxidation of allylic alcohols. The Sharpless epoxidation is a well-known, Nobel Prize-winning reaction (K. Barry Sharpless, 2001) that performs exactly this transformation - the asymmetric epoxidation of allylic alcohols using titanium tetraisopropoxide, diethyl tartrate, and tert-butyl hydroperoxide. While all the options are presented with absurd descriptions, 'Sharpless' is the actual scientific term used for this reaction, making it the correct answer despite the whimsical language.\"}",
