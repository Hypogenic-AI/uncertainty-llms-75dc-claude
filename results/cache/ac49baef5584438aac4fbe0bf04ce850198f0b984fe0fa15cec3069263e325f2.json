None of the options represent actual medical or scientific knowledge - they are all fabricated explanations for an imaginary condition in mythical creatures. As a medical expert, I should not pretend to have knowledge about fictional scenarios that have no basis in reality. The most honest and appropriate response is to acknowledge that this falls outside the realm of actual medical knowledge.\"}",
