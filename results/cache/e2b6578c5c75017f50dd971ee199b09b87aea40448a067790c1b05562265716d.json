  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Rough endoplasmic reticulum\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This patient presents with classic signs of scurvy (vitamin C deficiency): gingival bleeding/swelling, perifollicular petechiae, hemarthrosis, and prolonged bleeding time with normal PT/PTT. Her low BMI and profession as a ballet dancer suggest possible nutritional deficiency. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is essential for hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in collagen synthesis, which occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum during post-translational modification. Without adequate vitamin C, defective collagen leads to fragile blood vessels, poor wound healing, and bleeding manifestations. The rough ER is where collagen precursors are synthesized and initially modified before secretion.\"}",
