The language is deliberately absurd ('swells to the size of a small moon,' 'hums to the tune of the universe') and contains no basis in real medical science. The question appears designed to elicit medical-sounding responses about a completely nonsensical premise. This is not a legitimate medical question and cannot be answered responsibly.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
