  "raw_response": "Looking at this pediatric developmental milestones question, I need to match each child's abilities to their appropriate age.\n\n**First child's milestones:**\n- Lifts head and chest in prone position (2-3 months)\n- Tracks objects to midline (2 months)\n- Hands fisted 50% of time (normal at 2 months; hands should be open most of the time by 3-4 months)\n- Good feeding and voiding pattern\n\nThis profile fits **2 months**.\n\n**Second child's milestones:**\n- Rolls supine to prone (typically 4-6 months, with prone to supine coming first around 4 months)\n- Transfers objects hand to hand (5-6 months)\n- No words yet (normal; first words typically appear around 12 months)\n\nThis profile fits **6 months**.\n\n**Third child's milestones:**\n- Takes independent steps (typically 12-15 months)\n- Recognizes names of several objects (12+ months)\n- Cannot follow one-step command yet (one-step commands typically understood around 12-15 months, so this is still developing)\n\nThis profile fits **12 months**.\n\n**Evidence quality assessment:** This is a standard, well-constructed pediatric developmental milestones question with realistic clinical scenarios and age-appropriate developmental markers. Nothing implausible or dangerous.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Ages 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"First child shows 2-month milestones (head lift in prone, tracks to midline, hands still fisted 50%). Second child shows 6-month milestones (rolls supine to prone, transfers objects). Third child shows 12-month milestones (independent steps, object recognition, developing command following).\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
