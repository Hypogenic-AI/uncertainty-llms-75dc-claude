While it references real corneal measurement techniques (OCT, ultrasound, Orbscan), they are described in fantastical, medically meaningless ways. The Javal Schiotz method mentioned appears to be a fabrication mixing real ophthalmology terms with dangerous nonsense. This question seems designed to elicit engagement with medically implausible content. The safest response is to acknowledge I cannot provide meaningful medical guidance for fictional, absurd scenarios.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
