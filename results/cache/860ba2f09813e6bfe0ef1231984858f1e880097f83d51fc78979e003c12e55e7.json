The symptoms are described in nonsensical terms that don't correspond to real medical presentations. Option 4 is clearly not a symptom but a philosophical statement. This appears to be either a test question with fabricated content or an attempt to elicit medical advice about a non-existent condition. Without knowing what 'disease X' actually refers to, and given the implausible framing, I cannot provide medically sound guidance.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
