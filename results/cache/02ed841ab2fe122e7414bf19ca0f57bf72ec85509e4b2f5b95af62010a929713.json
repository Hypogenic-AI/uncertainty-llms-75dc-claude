The student's answer (option 3) is incorrect because not all phase changes are spontaneous or increase entropy - for example, freezing water at low temperatures is spontaneous but decreases entropy. Option 2 is correct: for an isolated system, the second law of thermodynamics states that \u0394S \u2265 0 for any possible process, with \u0394S > 0 for spontaneous processes and \u0394S = 0 for reversible equilibrium. This allows us to determine if a transformation is thermodynamically possible. Option 0 is incorrect (closed systems can have entropy decrease if heat flows out). Option 1 is partially correct about disorder but the temperature relationship with entropy change (\u0394S = q/T) makes the statement confusing as written.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"\n}\n```",
