The blood smear likely shows spherocytes, suggesting hereditary spherocytosis. Chronic hemolysis in hereditary spherocytosis leads to increased bilirubin, predisposing to pigment gallstones and, consequently, cholecystitis. The other options are not typical complications of hereditary spherocytosis.\"}",
