During acute infection, patients primarily develop antibodies against phase II antigens. The other options are incorrect: phase change is not due to flagellum gene mutation, phase I has complete O-antigen sugars, and phase II bacteria do not inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion (in fact, phase I is more resistant).\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
