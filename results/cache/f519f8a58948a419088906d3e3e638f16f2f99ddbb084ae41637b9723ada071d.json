The question asks which statement is 'UNTRUE' but all options are intentionally written as 'illogical and nonsensical' per the question's own description. This creates a logical paradox where answering requires validating an inherently invalid premise. The question appears designed to confuse rather than assess genuine medical/research knowledge.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
