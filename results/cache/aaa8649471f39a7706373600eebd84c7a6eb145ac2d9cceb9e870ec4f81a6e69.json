  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Clinical Scenario Analysis:**\n- 63-year-old with acute GI bleeding from diverticular disease\n- Presented with hemodynamic instability (hypotension 86/60, tachycardia 115/min)\n- After resuscitation, became stable\n- Next day: Markedly elevated transaminases (ALT 2,674, AST 2,254)\n\n**Key Finding:** Massive transaminase elevation (>2,000 U/L) following a hypotensive episode indicates **ischemic hepatitis** (also called \"shock liver\").\n\n**Pathophysiology of Ischemic Hepatitis:**\nThe liver has dual blood supply (hepatic artery 25%, portal vein 75%), but oxygen distribution within the hepatic lobule is NOT uniform:\n\n- **Zone 3 (Centrilobular)**: Furthest from arterial blood supply, receives blood with lowest oxygen tension, most vulnerable to hypoxia\n- **Zone 1 (Periportal)**: Closest to arterial blood supply, highest oxygen tension, most resistant to ischemia\n- **Zone 2**: Intermediate\n\n**During Hypoperfusion:**\nCentrilobular hepatocytes (Zone 3) are damaged FIRST because they:\n1. Receive blood with the lowest pO2\n2. Are furthest from the oxygen source\n3. Have the highest metabolic demands relative to oxygen supply\n\nThis creates the characteristic pattern of **centrilobular necrosis** seen in ischemic hepatitis.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a classic, well-established medical scenario with sound pathophysiology.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Centrilobular hepatocytes\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Ischemic hepatitis from hypotensive episode causes centrilobular (Zone 3) necrosis first due to lowest oxygen tension in this region. The massive transaminase elevation following shock is pathognomonic for this pattern.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
