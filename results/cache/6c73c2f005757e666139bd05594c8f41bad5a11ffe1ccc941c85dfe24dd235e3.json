  "raw_response": "Looking at this question, I need to identify which statement about calcium in the body contains an ERROR.\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\n**Option 0**: \"99% of calcium is stored skeletal system in the body, calcium accounted for slightly less than 1%\"\n- This is CORRECT. About 99% of body calcium is in bones/teeth, with ~1% in extracellular fluid and soft tissues.\n\n**Option 1**: \"The main source of calcium dietary intake is mostly absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum\"\n- This is CORRECT. Calcium absorption occurs primarily in the duodenum and proximal jejunum where conditions are optimal.\n\n**Option 2**: \"98% is reabsorbed calcium kidney, mainly in the distal end of the tubular\"\n- This contains an ERROR. While ~98-99% of filtered calcium IS reabsorbed by the kidneys, the LOCATION is wrong. The majority of calcium reabsorption occurs in the:\n  - Proximal tubule (~65%)\n  - Thick ascending limb of loop of Henle (~25%)\n  - Distal tubule (~8-10%)\n  \nThe distal tubule is where regulated (fine-tuning) reabsorption occurs under PTH control, but it's NOT where \"mainly\" reabsorption happens.\n\n**Option 3**: \"1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D binding proteins can increase the intestinal calcium (calcium binding protein) to enhance the absorption of calcium\"\n- This is CORRECT. 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D (calcitriol) induces synthesis of calbindin (calcium-binding protein) in intestinal cells, which enhances calcium absorption.\n\nSince the student's answer was Option 3 (which is actually correct), and we need to identify the INCORRECT statement, the answer must be **Option 2**.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"98% is reabsorbed calcium kidney, mainly in the distal end of the tubular\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"While ~98% of filtered calcium is reabsorbed by the kidneys, the statement incorrectly identifies the distal tubule as the main",
