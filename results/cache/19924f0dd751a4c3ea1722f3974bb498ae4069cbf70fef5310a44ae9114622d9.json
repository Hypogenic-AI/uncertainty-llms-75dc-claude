  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Bishydroxy coumarin\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This question asks what vitamin K antagonizes. The student incorrectly answered that vitamin K antagonizes production of clotting factors by liver. However, vitamin K actually PROMOTES (not antagonizes) the production of clotting factors. Vitamin K antagonists (like warfarin/bishydroxycoumarin) are anticoagulants that work by blocking vitamin K's action. Therefore, vitamin K antagonizes the anticoagulant effect of bishydroxycoumarin - they have opposite effects. Vitamin K reverses the action of warfarin/bishydroxycoumarin, making option 2 the correct answer.\"}",
