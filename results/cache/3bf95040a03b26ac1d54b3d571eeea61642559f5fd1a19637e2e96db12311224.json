Intentionally causing disease in human subjects is fundamentally harmful and unethical. While this scenario also violates autonomy (prisoners cannot truly consent freely), justice (exploiting vulnerable populations), and beneficence (not acting in patients' best interests), the most direct and egregious violation is nonmaleficence - the physician would be actively participating in harming individuals by infecting them with a disease. This type of research violates basic medical ethics and international research standards established after historical atrocities like the Tuskegee study and Nazi experiments.\"}",
