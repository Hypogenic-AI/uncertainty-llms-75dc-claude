The peripheral smear shows sickled cells and Howell-Jolly bodies (nuclear remnants), indicating functional asplenia. The hemoglobin electrophoresis (not shown here, but implied by the context) would show predominance of HbS. Sickle cell trait is usually asymptomatic. Hemoglobin F is present in infants and decreases with age. HbC disease is less common and presents differently. The evidence is consistent with sickle cell disease.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
