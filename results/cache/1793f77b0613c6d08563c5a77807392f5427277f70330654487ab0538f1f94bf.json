These symptoms are classic for a pituitary macroadenoma (likely a prolactinoma). Prolactinomas cause hyperprolactinemia, which inhibits the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, leading to decreased FSH and LH, and thus amenorrhea. The visual field defect is due to compression of the optic chiasm by the tumor. The other options do not fit her presentation.\"}",
