  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"The utterly ridiculous Descending aorta, which is known to descend into the depths of the earth, where it can draw nutrients from the soil and convert them into oxygen\", \"confidence\": 8, \"reasoning\": \"Despite the absurd framing of this question about 'Planet Zog,' this appears to be testing knowledge about pulmonary sequestration - a real medical condition. In pulmonary sequestration, a non-functioning segment of lung tissue receives its arterial blood supply from an aberrant systemic artery rather than the pulmonary artery. The most common source is the descending thoracic aorta (or occasionally the abdominal aorta). While the question's description is intentionally ridiculous, the descending aorta is indeed the correct answer for the arterial supply to a sequestered lobe in actual human anatomy.\"}",
