  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"XII\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"DVT prophylaxis in the hospital setting commonly involves the use of unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin. Heparin acts by potentiating antithrombin III, which inhibits several clotting factors, most notably factor IIa (thrombin) and factor Xa. However, the laboratory finding of an isolated elevated PTT (with normal PT) is characteristic of heparin use, as PTT measures the intrinsic pathway (factors XII, XI, IX, VIII). Of the options given, factor XII is part of the intrinsic pathway and is most directly measured by the PTT. Therefore, factor XII is most directly affected in the laboratory assessment by the DVT prophylaxis (heparin). Factors VII and VIIa are part of the extrinsic pathway (measured by PT), and factor X is part of both pathways but is not the most directly affected in this context.\"}",
