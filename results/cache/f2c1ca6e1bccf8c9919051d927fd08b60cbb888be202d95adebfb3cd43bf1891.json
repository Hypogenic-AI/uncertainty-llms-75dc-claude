  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- 64-year-old male with chronic bilateral knee pain\n- Pain worsens with activity, improves with rest\n- Minimal morning stiffness (5-10 minutes)\n- Physical exam: bony tenderness, crepitus, decreased ROM, cool joints, bony enlargement at medial joint line\n\n**Clinical Assessment:**\nThis is a classic presentation of **osteoarthritis (OA)**:\n- Age >50\n- Mechanical pain pattern (worse with activity, better with rest)\n- Brief morning stiffness (<30 minutes, unlike inflammatory arthritis)\n- Crepitus and bony enlargement\n- Cool joints (not inflamed)\n\n**Diagnostic Approach for OA:**\nAccording to clinical guidelines (ACR criteria), OA is primarily a **clinical diagnosis** based on:\n- Age >50\n- Activity-related joint pain\n- Morning stiffness <30 minutes\n- Physical findings (crepitus, bony enlargement, limited ROM)\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n- **CBC**: Not indicated - no signs of infection or systemic disease\n- **ESR**: Not indicated - this is mechanical, not inflammatory arthritis (cool joints, minimal stiffness)\n- **MRI**: Not routinely indicated for straightforward OA diagnosis; reserved for atypical presentations or when considering surgery\n- **No further work-up**: Correct - this is a straightforward clinical diagnosis of OA\n\nPlain radiographs could be considered if diagnosis is uncertain, but they're not listed and often not necessary for typical presentations.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"No further work-up needed\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Classic presentation of osteoarthritis with characteristic mechanical pain, minimal morning stiffness, and physical findings. OA is a clinical diagnosis in straightforward cases. No red flags present requiring additional testing.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
