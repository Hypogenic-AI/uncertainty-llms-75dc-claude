  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this clinical case systematically.\n\n**EVIDENCE QUALITY ASSESSMENT**: This is a medically plausible case presenting a common neonatal condition with realistic clinical findings and laboratory values. The scenario is coherent and evidence-based.\n\n**CLINICAL ANALYSIS**:\n\nKey findings:\n- 2-day-old newborn with jaundice (onset at 16 hours of life)\n- Early jaundice (within 24 hours) suggests hemolytic disease\n- Elevated indirect bilirubin (11.0 mg/dL of 11.3 total)\n- Anemia (Hgb 11 g/dL - low for newborn)\n- Elevated reticulocytes (9% - indicates hemolysis)\n- Hepatosplenomegaly (suggests extramedullary hematopoiesis)\n\nBlood group information:\n- Mother: O, Rh-negative with positive anti-Rh antibody titer\n- Baby: B, Rh-negative\n\n**Evaluating each option**:\n\n1. **RBC sickling (Option 0)**: Unlikely. Sickle cell disease doesn't typically present with jaundice in the first days of life. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) protects against sickling in newborns.\n\n2. **Anti-D antibodies (Option 1)**: The baby is Rh-negative, so anti-D antibodies wouldn't cause hemolysis. This is a distractor.\n\n3. **Biliary duct malformation (Option 2)**: Would cause direct (conjugated) hyperbilirubinemia, but this baby has indirect hyperbilirubinemia (10.0 mg/dL indirect).\n\n4. **Anti-B antibodies (Option 3)**: **CORRECT**. This is ABO incompatibility. Mother is type O (has anti-A and anti-B antibodies), baby is type B. Maternal IgG anti-B antibodies crossed the placenta and are causing hemolysis of fetal RBCs, explaining the indirect hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, reticulocytosis, and hepatosplenom",
