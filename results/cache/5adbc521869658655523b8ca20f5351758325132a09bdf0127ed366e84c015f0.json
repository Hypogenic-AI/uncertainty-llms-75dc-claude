Recall bias is common in such studies, as mothers of children with ASD may remember or report exposures differently than mothers of healthy children. The other options are less likely: interviewer bias is possible but less central, latency period refers to time between exposure and outcome (not a bias), and survival bias is not relevant here.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
