  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this medical question systematically.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a standard clinical vignette with plausible presentation - hypertension treatment causing bilateral lower extremity edema. The timeline, vital signs, and clinical findings are all medically sound. **Evidence quality: normal**\n\n**Clinical Analysis:**\n\nKey facts:\n- 50-year-old man with hypertension\n- Started new medication 3 months ago\n- Developed bilateral leg edema 2 months later (1 month after starting medication)\n- Blood pressure still elevated (145/95)\n- Labs normal (rules out renal/hepatic causes)\n\n**Drug Side Effect Profile:**\n\n1. **Amlodipine (CCB)**: Calcium channel blockers, especially dihydropyridines like amlodipine, commonly cause peripheral edema (10-30% of patients) due to preferential arteriolar vasodilation causing increased capillary hydrostatic pressure. This is the MOST LIKELY answer.\n\n2. **Hydrochlorothiazide (thiazide diuretic)**: Actually REDUCES edema; would not cause it. Student's answer is incorrect.\n\n3. **Losartan (ARB)**: Does not typically cause edema; may actually reduce it.\n\n4. **Spironolactone (K-sparing diuretic)**: Also reduces edema; would not cause it.\n\nThe bilateral lower extremity edema with normal labs after starting antihypertensive medication is classic for calcium channel blocker-induced edema.\n\n**Correct Answer: Amlodipine (Option 3)**\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Amlodipine\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Bilateral lower extremity edema with normal labs after starting antihypertensive medication is pathognomonic for calcium channel blocker (CCB) side effects. Amlodipine causes peripheral edema in 10-30% of patients via preferential arteriolar vasodilation. Diuretics like hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone would reduce, not cause, edema.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}\n```",
