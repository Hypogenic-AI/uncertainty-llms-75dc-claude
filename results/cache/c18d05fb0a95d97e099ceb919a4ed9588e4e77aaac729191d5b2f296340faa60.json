  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Clinical Presentation Analysis:**\n- 29-year-old male with infertility\n- Tall stature, long extremities, sparse body hair\n- Gynecomastia, small testes\n- Elevated FSH and increased estradiol:testosterone ratio\n- Cytogenetic abnormality\n\nThis clinical picture is classic for **Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY)**.\n\n**Genetic Mechanism:**\nThe question states this was inherited from the father. For a father to pass an extra X chromosome to his son, the error must involve:\n- Normal fertilization: X (from egg) + XY (from abnormal sperm) = XXY\n\n**Spermatogenesis Stages and Nondisjunction:**\n\n1. **Primary spermatocyte (diploid, 46,XY)**: Undergoes Meiosis I\n   - If nondisjunction occurs here: XY chromosomes fail to separate\n   - Results in secondary spermatocytes with either XY or no sex chromosome\n   - After Meiosis II: produces sperm with XY or no sex chromosome\n\n2. **Secondary spermatocyte (haploid, 23,X or 23,Y)**: Undergoes Meiosis II\n   - If nondisjunction occurs in the X-bearing secondary spermatocyte\n   - Sister chromatids fail to separate\n   - Results in sperm with XX or no sex chromosome (not XY)\n\n3. **Spermatid/Spermatozoon**: Post-meiotic; no further division occurs\n\nFor paternal transmission of XXY, the father must contribute both X and Y chromosomes in a single sperm. This only occurs when nondisjunction happens during **Meiosis I** in the **primary spermatocyte**.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Primary spermatocyte\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) from paternal origin requires both X and Y chromosomes in one sperm, which only occurs from nondisjunction during Meiosis I in the primary sper",
