The laboratory findings show a positive polysaccharide antigen (which can be detected in urine for Histoplasma), and bronchoalveolar lavage reveals macrophages filled with a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae. Histoplasma is known to be found within macrophages and is a dimorphic fungus endemic to the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys. The other options do not fit the epidemiology, clinical presentation, or laboratory findings as well as Histoplasma.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
