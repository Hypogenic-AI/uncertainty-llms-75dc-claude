INO is caused by a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), which coordinates conjugate horizontal gaze. Bilateral INO in a young adult is classically due to demyelination, most commonly multiple sclerosis. Other options (tumor, infarction, thiamine deficiency) are less likely to cause isolated, bilateral MLF lesions in this age group.\"}",
