The most appropriate pharmacotherapy is to stimulate neutrophil production with a myeloid growth factor such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The other options do not address neutropenia: TGF-\u03b2 is immunosuppressive, erythropoietin stimulates red blood cell production, and IL-5 stimulates eosinophils.\"}",
