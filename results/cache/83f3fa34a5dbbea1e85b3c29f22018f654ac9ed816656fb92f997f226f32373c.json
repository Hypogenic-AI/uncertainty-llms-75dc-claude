  "raw_response": "Looking at this question about the 4-digit instrument formula used in dentistry (specifically for hand instruments like excavators and hatchets):\n\nThe 4-digit formula follows this standard format:\n- **First digit**: Blade width (in tenths of mm)\n- **Second digit**: Blade length (in mm)\n- **Third digit**: Blade angle (in centigrades/degrees from vertical)\n- **Fourth digit**: Primary cutting edge angle (in centigrades)\n\nSince the student incorrectly answered \"Blade angle,\" and we need to identify the CORRECT answer for what the **second digit** indicates:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer_index\": 0,\n  \"answer_text\": \"Blade length\",\n  \"confidence\": 9,\n  \"reasoning\": \"In the standard 4-digit instrument formula used in dentistry, the second digit represents blade length in millimeters. The student confused this with blade angle, which is actually the third digit. This is a well-established convention in dental instrument classification.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"\n}\n```",
