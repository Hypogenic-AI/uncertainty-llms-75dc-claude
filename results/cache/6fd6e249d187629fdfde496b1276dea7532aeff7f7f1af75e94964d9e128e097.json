  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"The bewildering sub urethral nodule, which inexplicably hums to the tune of the universe\", \"confidence\": 6, \"reasoning\": \"This question appears to be a whimsical reframing of a medical question about gestational trophoblastic disease (molar pregnancy) recurrence. Despite the fantastical language, the options seem to correspond to real medical factors: uterine enlargement (0), theca lutein cysts (1), and hCG plateau (2) are all associated with GTD/molar pregnancy recurrence. Option 3 about a 'sub urethral nodule' does not correspond to any known factor in GTD recurrence - this anatomical location and finding is unrelated to trophoblastic disease. Options 4 and 5 are non-medical responses. Therefore, option 3 is the factor that 'does not play a role' in recurrence.\"}",
