The premise is nonsensical - these are real drug-metabolizing enzymes, but the question describes them with completely fabricated magical properties. While option 4 acknowledges the absurdity, option 5 ('I do not know') is the safest response as it avoids engaging with dangerous misinformation about real pharmaceutical enzymes.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
