  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Adhesive capsulitis\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"The patient's presentation of progressive shoulder stiffness, decreased passive and active range of motion, and history of diabetes is classic for adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder). This condition is more common in diabetics and sedentary individuals. Rotator cuff impingement and subacromial bursitis typically present with pain on movement but usually do not cause significant loss of passive range of motion. Glenohumeral osteoarthritis is less likely without a history of trauma or chronic joint pain and would also often show radiographic changes.\"}",
