  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 4, \"answer_text\": \"Conceding defeat to the overwhelming absurdity of this question and accepting that this question defies all reason, logic, and sanity\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"This question is deliberately constructed to be absurd and nonsensical, mixing fantasy elements (dragons, magic, 300-year-old women) with medical terminology. While it references real prenatal tests (triple test, amniocentesis, cordocentesis, chorionic villus sampling), the context is entirely fantastical and the question itself acknowledges its own absurdity by asking for 'the most absurd and unreasonable test.' The most appropriate response is to acknowledge that this question has no legitimate medical answer, as it exists purely in a realm of fantasy that 'defies all reason, logic, and sanity.' Option 4 is the only honest and reasonable response to an intentionally unreasonable question.\"}",
