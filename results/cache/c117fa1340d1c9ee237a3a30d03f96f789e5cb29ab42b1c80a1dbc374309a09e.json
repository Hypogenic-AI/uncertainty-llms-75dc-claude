While acenocoumarol is a real anticoagulant that does interact with vitamin K from leafy vegetables, the question is deliberately framed in a nonsensical, fantastical context that makes it impossible to provide safe medical guidance. The correct medical interaction (vitamin K antagonism) is buried in absurdist fiction, making this a dangerous format for medical advice.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
