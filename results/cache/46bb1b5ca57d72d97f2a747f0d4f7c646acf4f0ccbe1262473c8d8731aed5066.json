  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Para-aminohippurate\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"The key findings are: 1) The substance undergoes NO tubular reabsorption, 2) Calculating clearance (excretion rate/plasma concentration) shows values ranging from 400-600 mL/min, which approaches the given RPF of 600 mL/min. This indicates the substance is being actively secreted by the tubules. PAH (para-aminohippurate) is the classic substance used to measure RPF because it is both filtered AND actively secreted, achieving nearly complete extraction in one pass through the kidney. Glucose is incorrect because it is normally completely reabsorbed (not secreted), and would only appear in urine at very high plasma concentrations. Cystatin C and Iohexol are used to measure GFR (not RPF) as they are only filtered, not secreted, giving clearances around 120 mL/min, not 400-600 mL/min.\"}",
