  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical case systematically:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- 59-year-old overweight woman\n- Severe abdominal pain with back pain, nausea, vomiting\n- History of cholelithiasis (gallstones)\n- Family history of abdominal cancer (father died at 60)\n- **CT shows calcified mass near gallbladder**\n\n**Critical Red Flags:**\n1. **Calcified mass near gallbladder** - this is highly concerning for malignancy\n2. **Family history of abdominal cancer**\n3. **Age and demographics** - appropriate for gallbladder cancer risk\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n**Gallbladder cancer (Option 1):**\n- Calcified mass is a RED FLAG finding\n- \"Porcelain gallbladder\" (calcified gallbladder wall) has 12-25% malignancy risk\n- Any calcified mass in this region requires urgent exclusion of malignancy\n- Family history adds to concern\n- Most serious diagnosis with worst prognosis if missed\n\n**Other diagnoses:**\n- Acute cholecystitis: Physical exam unremarkable (no Murphy's sign mentioned), vital signs stable\n- Choledocholithiasis: Possible, but less urgent than cancer\n- Pancreatitis: Possible with back pain, but would expect more systemic signs\n\n**Medical Priority Principle:**\nWhen a finding suggests possible malignancy (calcified mass), this must be excluded FIRST because:\n- Highest mortality if missed\n- Treatment window is critical\n- Other diagnoses can be managed even if delayed slightly\n\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Gallbladder cancer\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"A calcified mass near the gallbladder on CT is a red flag for malignancy, especially with family history of abdominal cancer. Gallbladder cancer must be excluded first as it has the worst prognosis if missed and requires urgent diagnosis. The other conditions, while possible, are less immediately life-threatening.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
