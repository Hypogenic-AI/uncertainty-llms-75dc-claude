While 'Gowers' sign' (likely what 'Groton's sign' refers to) is a real clinical finding associated with proximal muscle weakness, the question deliberately obscures medical facts with absurd magical descriptions. The options mix real medical conditions (dermatomyositis, SLE, scleroderma, MCTD) with completely nonsensical 'dark magic' descriptions that make it impossible to provide safe, evidence-based medical guidance. This appears designed to elicit medical information in a context that undermines patient safety and rational medical decision-making.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
