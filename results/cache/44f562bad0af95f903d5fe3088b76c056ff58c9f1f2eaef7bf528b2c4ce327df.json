The most appropriate next step is to confirm the diagnosis with a urinalysis (and urine culture), not imaging. Imaging is reserved for complicated cases or lack of improvement. Cervical swab is not indicated unless there are symptoms of cervicitis or PID. Blood cultures may be obtained if the patient is septic, but urinalysis is the initial diagnostic test of choice.\"}",
