These findings are classic for Plummer-Vinson syndrome, which is characterized by the triad of iron deficiency anemia, dysphagia due to esophageal web, and koilonychia. The laboratory findings of low hemoglobin further support iron deficiency anemia. Other options do not fit the combination of esophageal web and iron deficiency anemia.\"}",
