  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation systematically:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- 45-year-old multiparous woman (G5P4105)\n- Heavy menstrual bleeding (soaking super absorbent tampon q2h \u00d7 5 days)\n- Irregular cycles with intermenstrual bleeding\n- Significant dysmenorrhea (requiring regular ibuprofen)\n- New dyspareunia\n- Pelvic pressure/\"heavy feeling\"\n- Urinary frequency (suggests mass effect)\n- Risk factors: obesity, multiparity, age\n\n**Differential Diagnosis:**\n\nThis constellation strongly suggests **adenomyosis** or **uterine fibroids (leiomyomas)**.\n\n**Adenomyosis** typically presents with:\n- Diffusely enlarged, **globular**, symmetrically enlarged uterus\n- Heavy bleeding, dysmenorrhea\n- Uniformly \"boggy\" texture\n- Usually modest enlargement (8-12 week size)\n\n**Fibroids** typically present with:\n- **Irregular**, asymmetrically enlarged uterus\n- Can be significantly larger\n- Firm, nodular contour\n- Bulk symptoms (urinary frequency, pelvic pressure)\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\nGiven the **urinary frequency** (suggesting significant mass effect) and **pelvic pressure**, this points more toward a larger uterine mass. The combination of heavy bleeding, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, AND bulk symptoms in a multiparous woman is most consistent with **uterine fibroids**.\n\n- Option 0 (Globular 10-week): More consistent with adenomyosis, but less likely to cause significant bulk symptoms\n- Option 2 (Irregular 14-week): Most consistent with **fibroids** - explains both bleeding symptoms AND bulk symptoms\n- Option 1 (Adnexal mass): Less likely; symptoms are more uterine in origin\n- Option 3 (No findings): Unlikely given clear symptomatic presentation\n\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Irregular 14-week sized uterus\", \"confidence\": 8, \"reasoning\": \"The combination of menorrhagia",
