The biopsy showing rounded contour with overgrowth of fibrous and glandular tissue is pathognomonic for fibroadenoma. While pregnancy can cause breast changes, they are typically bilateral and diffuse, not a discrete mass. Fat necrosis usually has trauma history and different histology. Phyllodes tumor would show leaf-like architecture on biopsy, not simple fibrous and glandular overgrowth.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
