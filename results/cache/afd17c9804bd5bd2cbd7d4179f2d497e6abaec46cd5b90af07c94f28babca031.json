  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this question about subcondylar fracture mechanics.\n\n**Understanding the anatomy and mechanics:**\n- A subcondylar fracture on the LEFT side affects the left condyle\n- The lateral pterygoid muscle attaches to the condyle and pulls it forward and medially during protrusion\n- When one condyle is fractured, it cannot function properly\n\n**Deviation mechanics with unilateral subcondylar fracture:**\n- During protrusion: The INTACT (right) condyle moves forward normally, while the FRACTURED (left) condyle cannot move properly\n- This causes the mandible to deviate TOWARD the side of the fracture (LEFT side)\n- During lateral excursion: The mandible cannot deviate AWAY from the fractured side effectively\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n- Option 0: Moderate bleeding - not a characteristic clinical finding\n- Option 1: Bilateral crepitus - unlikely with unilateral fracture\n- Option 2: Deviation to the RIGHT - this is INCORRECT (the student's answer). With a LEFT fracture, deviation would be to the LEFT\n- Option 3: Inability to deviate to the RIGHT - this is CORRECT. With a left subcondylar fracture, the patient cannot effectively move the mandible to the contralateral (right) side\n\n**The correct answer is Option 3.**\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Inability to deviate the mandible to the right\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"With a left subcondylar fracture, the left condyle cannot function properly.
