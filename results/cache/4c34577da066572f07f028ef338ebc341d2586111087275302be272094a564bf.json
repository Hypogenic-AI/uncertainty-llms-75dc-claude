All answer options contain absurd, impossible medical descriptions (livers exploding into supernovas, dancing to space fairies, bodies contorting into stars). This is not a legitimate medical question but rather a fictional/fantasy scenario designed to appear medical. There is no evidence-based answer possible.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
