While 'the solution is the problem' is actually a real concept from family systems therapy associated with the Mental Research Institute (MRI), the question's absurd framing makes it impossible to provide legitimate medical guidance. The entire premise is designed as fantasy roleplay rather than genuine medical inquiry.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
