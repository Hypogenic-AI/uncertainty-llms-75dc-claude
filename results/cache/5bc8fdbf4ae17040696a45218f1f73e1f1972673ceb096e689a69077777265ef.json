  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Clinical Presentation:**\n- 24-year-old man with 6-week history of loose stools\n- Abdominal pain, fever, nausea\n- RLQ tenderness\n- Elevated WBC (14,800) and ESR (51)\n- Negative stool studies\n\n**Key Imaging Finding:**\n- CT shows mural thickening and fat stranding in **discrete regions** of terminal ileum AND transverse colon\n- This \"skip lesions\" pattern affecting both small and large bowel is classic for Crohn's disease\n\n**Differential Analysis:**\n\nThe question asks for the most **specific** finding. Let me evaluate each option:\n\n1. **Neutrophilic inflammation of crypts (cryptitis/crypt abscesses)**: \n   - Seen in both Crohn's disease AND ulcerative colitis\n   - Not specific\n\n2. **Neutrophil-rich pseudomembranes**:\n   - Characteristic of C. difficile colitis\n   - Stool studies were negative\n   - Not consistent with this case\n\n3. **Noncaseating granulomas**:\n   - Found in 15-30% of Crohn's disease cases\n   - When present, highly specific for Crohn's disease\n   - Not seen in ulcerative colitis or infectious colitis\n   - **Most specific finding**\n\n4. **Pseudopolyps**:\n   - Inflammatory polyps from mucosal regeneration\n   - Can occur in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis\n   - Not specific\n\nWhile noncaseating granulomas are only present in a minority of Crohn's cases, when they ARE found, they are the most specific histologic feature for distinguishing Crohn's disease from other inflammatory bowel conditions.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Formation of noncaseating granulomas\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"The clinical presentation (skip lesions in terminal ileum and transverse colon, RLQ pain, young adult) is classic for Crohn's disease.
