  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Amlodipine\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"The patient developed bilateral lower extremity edema 2 months after starting a new antihypertensive medication. This is a classic side effect of calcium channel blockers, particularly dihydropyridines like amlodipine. The mechanism is peripheral vasodilation leading to increased capillary hydrostatic pressure and fluid extravasation. Hydrochlorothiazide (the student's answer) is a thiazide diuretic that would typically reduce edema, not cause it. Losartan (ARB) and spironolactone (potassium-sparing diuretic) are not commonly associated with peripheral edema. The timing, bilateral presentation, and normal lab values all point to amlodipine as the culprit medication.\"}",
