  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Anti-B antibodies\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This newborn has jaundice, anemia, reticulocytosis, and mild hepatosplenomegaly, suggesting hemolytic disease of the newborn. The mother is blood group O, the baby is blood group B, and the mother likely has anti-A and anti-B IgG antibodies that can cross the placenta and cause hemolysis in the baby. The baby and mother are both Rh-negative, so anti-D antibodies are not the cause. Sickle cell disease is unlikely in a 2-day-old and would not cause this presentation. Biliary duct malformation would cause direct hyperbilirubinemia, but this baby has indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia. Therefore, the most likely cause is hemolysis due to maternal anti-B antibodies.\"}",
