  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this clinical case systematically.\n\n**Clinical Presentation Analysis:**\n- 3-month-old infant with:\n  - Productive cough (5 days)\n  - Recurrent watery diarrhea (1 month)\n  - Failure to thrive (5th percentile for height and weight)\n  - Fever (38.5\u00b0C)\n  - Tachycardia and tachypnea\n  - Oral thrush (white plaques on tongue/palate)\n  - Bilateral rales (pneumonia)\n  - Generalized lymphadenopathy (cervical and inguinal)\n  - No prenatal care, home delivery, no immunizations\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a medically plausible case presenting classic signs of pediatric immunodeficiency with opportunistic infections.\n\n**Key Diagnostic Clues:**\n1. **Oral thrush** in a 3-month-old (Candida - opportunistic infection)\n2. **Pneumonia** with productive cough (likely Pneumocystis jirovecii given age and context)\n3. **Failure to thrive** with chronic diarrhea\n4. **Generalized lymphadenopathy**\n5. **No prenatal care** - mother's HIV status unknown\n6. **Recurrent infections** at young age\n\n**Differential Consideration:**\n- **HIV infection (vertical transmission)**: Most likely - explains ALL findings\n- CFTR mutation (CF): Would cause failure to thrive and respiratory issues but NOT oral thrush, lymphadenopathy, or this infection pattern\n- Congenital syphilis (FTA-ABS): Possible but doesn't explain opportunistic infections like thrush\n- Chromosomal abnormality: Doesn't explain this specific infection pattern\n\n**Most Likely Diagnosis:** Vertically transmitted HIV infection with AIDS-defining opportunistic infections (thrush, probable PCP pneumonia)\n\n**Confirmatory Test:** PCR for viral genes (HIV DNA/RNA PCR) - the gold standard for diagnosing HIV in infants <18 months (antibody tests unreliable due to maternal antibodies)\n\n{\"answer_index\":",
