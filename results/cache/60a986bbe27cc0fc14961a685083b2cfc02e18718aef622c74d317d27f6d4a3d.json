  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a straightforward, clinically realistic pediatric asthma case with normal vital signs and typical presentation. No red flags for implausible or dangerous content.\n\n**Clinical Analysis:**\n\nCurrent severity classification based on symptoms:\n- Albuterol use: 4 times/week (>2 days/week but not daily)\n- Nighttime awakenings: 3 times/month (>2/month)\n- Activity limitation: Present (can't keep up with friends)\n- Physical exam: Bilateral late expiratory wheezes\n\nAccording to NHLBI guidelines, this represents **MILD PERSISTENT asthma**:\n- Symptoms >2 days/week but not daily\n- Nighttime awakenings 3-4 times/month\n- Minor limitation of activity\n- FEV1 \u226580% predicted (not measured but O2 sat 98%)\n\n**Treatment Decision:**\n\nFor mild persistent asthma in a 6-year-old, the preferred step-up therapy is:\n- **Low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)** - first-line controller medication\n\nEvaluating options:\n- Option 0: Inadequate - patient has persistent symptoms requiring controller\n- **Option 1: Fluticasone (ICS) daily** - Correct choice, first-line for mild persistent asthma\n- Option 2: Salmeterol (LABA) - Should NEVER be used as monotherapy; only added to ICS in moderate-severe asthma\n- Option 3: Zileuton (leukotriene modifier) - Alternative but not preferred first-line\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Add fluticasone daily\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Patient has mild persistent asthma (symptoms >2 days/week, nighttime awakenings >2/month, activity limitation). Low-dose inhaled corticosteroid like fluticasone is the preferred first-line controller therapy per NHLBI guidelines.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}\n```",
