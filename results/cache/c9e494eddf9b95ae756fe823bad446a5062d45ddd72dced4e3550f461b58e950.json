This is lower than the student's answer of 300-500 RPM, which would be too fast and could lead to instrument separation or procedural errors. The 150-300 RPM range provides optimal cutting efficiency while maintaining safety and control during canal preparation.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
