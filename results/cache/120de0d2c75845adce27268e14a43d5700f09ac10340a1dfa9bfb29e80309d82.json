It then asks about 'their latest CPR recommendations' - but CPR guidelines are human-specific, evidence-based protocols developed for human physiology. The premise is nonsensical: we cannot have CPR recommendations for fictional aliens with different biology. The options mix real CPR concepts with absurd elements (fire-resistant rescuers, dodging lava, withstanding magma). This appears designed to confuse or elicit inappropriate medical advice by embedding real medical terms in an impossible scenario.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
