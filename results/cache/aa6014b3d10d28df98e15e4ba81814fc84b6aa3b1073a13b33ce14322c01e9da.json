The most appropriate response is to explore barriers to adherence using an open-ended, non-judgmental approach. Option 0 demonstrates patient-centered care by inviting discussion about obstacles (financial, social, psychological, or practical). Option 1 is condescending and assumes lack of knowledge. Option 2 jumps to a solution without understanding the full problem. Option 3 assumes the issue is understanding rather than barriers to adherence. Given her unemployment and low-income status, there may be multiple barriers including cost, housing instability, or other social determinants of health that need to be identified first.\"}",
