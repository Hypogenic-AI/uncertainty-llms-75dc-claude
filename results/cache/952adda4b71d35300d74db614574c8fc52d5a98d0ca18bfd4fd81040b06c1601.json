The restoration of choice in such cases is typically a cast metal restoration (such as a cast metal crown or onlay), as it provides strength and durability to withstand occlusal forces. Intermediate restorations, composite, and GIC are not sufficiently strong for such extensive cusp involvement.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
