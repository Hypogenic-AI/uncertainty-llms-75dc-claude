This condition is most common in postmenopausal women and presents with these characteristic findings. Squamous cell hyperplasia typically presents with thickened, leathery skin from chronic scratching. Squamous cell carcinoma would likely present with a mass or ulcer. Lichen planus may cause erosive lesions but usually has a violaceous hue and different distribution.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
