  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Hypoglossal\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Somatic efferent nerves control skeletal muscles. The question asks which nerve with somatic efferent fibers arises from the medulla. Oculomotor (CN III) and Trochlear (CN IV) arise from the midbrain. Abducent (CN VI) arises from the pontomedullary junction/pons. Hypoglossal (CN XII) arises from the medulla and is a pure somatic efferent nerve controlling tongue muscles. Therefore, Hypoglossal is the correct answer.\"}",
