  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- 3-week-old with bilious vomiting (greenish, concerning for obstruction)\n- Delayed passage of meconium (50 hours - abnormal, should be <48 hours)\n- Infrequent bowel movements (1/day is low for newborn)\n- Failure to thrive (10th percentile weight)\n- Abdominal distension\n- **Explosive release of stool after rectal exam** (pathognomonic sign)\n- X-ray: dilated colon followed by segment without stool/air (transition zone)\n- Dysmorphic features suggesting possible chromosomal abnormality (Down syndrome features)\n\n**Diagnosis: Hirschsprung Disease**\n\nThe clinical picture is classic for Hirschsprung disease:\n- Delayed meconium passage\n- Chronic constipation with abdominal distension\n- Explosive stool after rectal stimulation (relieves functional obstruction)\n- Transition zone on imaging (dilated proximal colon, narrow aganglionic distal segment)\n- Association with Down syndrome (10-15% of Hirschsprung patients)\n\n**Diagnostic Confirmation:**\n\nThe gold standard for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease is **rectal suction biopsy**, which demonstrates:\n- Absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric (Auerbach's) and submucosal (Meissner's) plexuses\n- Hypertrophied nerve fibers\n- Increased acetylcholinesterase activity\n\nAnorectal manometry can be helpful but is less definitive and technically difficult in newborns. The other options (CT, ultrasound) are not diagnostic for Hirschsprung disease.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a medically sound, well-constructed clinical vignette with classic presentation of a real pediatric condition.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Rectal suction biopsy\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Classic Hirschsprung disease presentation with delayed meconium, explosive stool after rectal exam,",
