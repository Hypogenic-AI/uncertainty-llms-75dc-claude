Crescents are composed of proliferating parietal epithelial cells and infiltrating macrophages in Bowman's space. This is the hallmark and most consistent feature of RPGN across all three types (anti-GBM, immune complex, and pauci-immune). Loss of foot processes (podocyte effacement) is characteristic of minimal change disease and nephrotic syndrome, not RPGN. Mesangial proliferation and IgA deposition are features of IgA nephropathy, which typically has a more indolent course.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
