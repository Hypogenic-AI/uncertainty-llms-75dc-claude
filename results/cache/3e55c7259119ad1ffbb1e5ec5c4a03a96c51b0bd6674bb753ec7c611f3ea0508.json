In the female reproductive tract, the fallopian tubes are lined by simple columnar epithelium with ciliated cells, but portions can have simple cuboidal epithelium. The ovaries have surface simple cuboidal/columnar epithelium (germinal epithelium). The vagina has stratified squamous epithelium, and the vulva has stratified squamous keratinized epithelium. The ovaries' surface epithelium is the best match for simple cuboidal epithelium described. However, reviewing more carefully: ovarian surface epithelium is indeed simple cuboidal to low columnar, making it the most accurate match to the thyroid's simple cuboidal epithelium. But the fallopian tubes have both ciliated columnar and secretory cells. The ovaries (option 0) are actually the better answer as their surface germinal epithelium is simple cuboidal, matching the thyroid description exactly.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}\n\nWait, let me reconsider: {\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Ovaries\", \"confidence\": 8, \"reasoning\": \"The thyroid follicles are lined by simple cuboidal epithelium.
