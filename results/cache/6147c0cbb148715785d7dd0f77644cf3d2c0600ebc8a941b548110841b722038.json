The student answered 2:1, which is lower than normal and would suggest erythroid hyperplasia. A ratio of 1:1 would be abnormally low (significant erythroid predominance), while 4:1 is at the upper end of normal. The answer '3:l' (interpreting 'l' as '1') represents the standard normal M:E ratio.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
