If the extra X chromosome was inherited from the father, the nondisjunction event occurred during meiosis I in the primary spermatocyte, when homologous chromosomes fail to separate. This is the stage where the error would result in a sperm carrying both an X and a Y chromosome.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
