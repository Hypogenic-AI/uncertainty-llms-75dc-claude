The physician would be directly causing harm by intentionally infecting healthy individuals with a disease. While this also violates autonomy (lack of consent), justice (exploiting vulnerable populations), and beneficence (not acting in patients' best interests), the PRIMARY violation is nonmaleficence - the fundamental duty not to intentionally harm patients. This echoes historical ethical violations like the Tuskegee study and Nazi experiments. The deliberate infliction of disease is the most direct and severe ethical breach here.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
