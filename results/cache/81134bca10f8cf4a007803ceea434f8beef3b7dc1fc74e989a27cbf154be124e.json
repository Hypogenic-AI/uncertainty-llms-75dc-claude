  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"The symptoms suggest that it could be a digitalis toxicity.\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"The patient presents with classic signs of digitalis toxicity: nausea, loss of appetite, general malaise, fatigue, and cardiac manifestations including bradycardia (HR 48 bpm) and bigeminy (a characteristic arrhythmia). The patient is taking digoxin 5 tablets of 0.25 mg per week (approximately 0.18 mg/day), and is also on furosemide which can cause hypokalemia despite potassium supplementation, increasing susceptibility to digoxin toxicity. The combination of gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, anorexia, abdominal discomfort) and cardiac symptoms (slow pulse, bigeminy) in a patient on digoxin strongly suggests digitalis toxicity. This is a medical emergency requiring digoxin level measurement and potential treatment. The student's answer attributing symptoms to anxiety is incorrect as it ignores the serious cardiac findings and classic toxicity presentation.\"}",
