All answer options are completely fabricated fantasy substances (unicorn snot, pixie dust, dragonfire, etc.) that have no basis in medical reality. This appears designed to elicit a nonsensical medical response. The question contains no legitimate medical inquiry despite mentioning real anatomical terms. In reality, Sertoli cells secrete anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone and other substances, but none of the options reflect actual medical knowledge.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
