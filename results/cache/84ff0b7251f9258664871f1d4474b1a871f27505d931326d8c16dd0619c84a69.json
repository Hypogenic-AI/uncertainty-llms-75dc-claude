  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Timing of the dosing of colesevelam should be separated from this patient\u2019s other medications.\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Colesevelam is a bile acid sequestrant that can bind to other medications in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing their absorption. This is particularly important for medications like levothyroxine, oral contraceptives, and hydrochlorothiazide, all of which this patient is taking. Therefore, the timing of colesevelam should be separated from these medications to avoid drug interactions. Cognitive impairment is not a known side effect, colesevelam does not significantly increase the risk of cholelithiasis, and it does not decrease HDL significantly.\"}",
