  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Clinical Presentation:**\n- 24-year-old woman with 4 months of fatigue\n- Tachycardia (pulse 121/min) - compensatory response to anemia\n- Pale conjunctivae - indicates anemia\n- Normal temperature and blood pressure\n\n**Key Finding:** Peripheral blood smear is mentioned (though not shown to me)\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\nGiven the demographic (young woman) and chronic fatigue with anemia, I need to consider the most common causes:\n\n**Iron deficiency (Option 2):**\n- Most common cause of anemia in young women\n- Causes: menstrual blood loss, dietary insufficiency, malabsorption\n- Presents with fatigue, pallor, tachycardia\n- Blood smear: microcytic, hypochromic RBCs with high RDW (anisocytosis)\n- This is the classic presentation\n\n**Vitamin B12 deficiency (Option 1):**\n- Less common in this age group without risk factors\n- Would show macrocytic RBCs with hypersegmented neutrophils\n- Usually requires longer to develop (years of stores)\n\n**Hereditary spherocytosis (Option 0):**\n- Would typically present earlier in life\n- Blood smear shows spherocytes, increased MCHC\n- Often has family history, jaundice, splenomegaly\n\n**\u03b2-thalassemia minor (Option 3):**\n- Usually asymptomatic or mild symptoms\n- Microcytic anemia but typically not this symptomatic\n- Would have elevated RBC count despite low hemoglobin\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a standard, medically sound clinical vignette with realistic presentation.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Iron deficiency\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Young woman with chronic fatigue, tachycardia, and pallor most commonly has iron deficiency anemia, typically from menstrual blood loss. This is the most prevalent cause of anemia in this demographic. The clinical presentation is classic for iron deficiency.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
