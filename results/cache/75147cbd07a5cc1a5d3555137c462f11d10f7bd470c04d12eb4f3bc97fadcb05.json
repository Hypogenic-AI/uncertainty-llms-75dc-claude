The question asks about the 'antithesis of gluconeogenesis' in a fictional universe with inverted natural laws, making any answer medically meaningless and potentially dangerous if applied to real clinical scenarios. The overwrought, mocking language ('utterly ridiculous,' 'complete madness') suggests this is designed to confuse rather than educate.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
