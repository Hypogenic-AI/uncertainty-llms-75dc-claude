Ketamine is an NMDA-receptor antagonist that is well-established for reducing opioid requirements and managing opioid-refractory pain. It's commonly used in palliative care settings for exactly this indication - severe cancer pain with dose-limiting opioid side effects. Propofol is a sedative-hypnotic, fentanyl is another opioid (wouldn't reduce opioid need), and midazolam is a benzodiazepine. Only ketamine has the NMDA-receptor mechanism described.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
