While mucoceles are real medical conditions affecting paranasal sinuses, this question is deliberately nonsensical and designed to elicit responses about fictional scenarios. The question defies medical reality and appears to be testing whether I'll engage with absurd premises.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
