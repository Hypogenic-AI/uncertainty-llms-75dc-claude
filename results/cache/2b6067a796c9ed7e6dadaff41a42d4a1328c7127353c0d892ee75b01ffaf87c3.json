While congenital CMV can cause multiple sequelae including mental retardation/developmental delay, the MOST COMMON long-term sequela is sensorineural hearing loss, which occurs in 30-65% of symptomatic cases and can be progressive. It is the leading non-genetic cause of childhood hearing loss. Mental retardation does occur but is less frequent than hearing loss. The question asks what the child is 'at risk of' - and hearing loss represents the highest risk sequela in congenital CMV.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
