GABA A receptors are the actual physiological receptors that mediate anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects. When activated, they produce calming and relaxing effects by increasing inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. This is the mechanism by which benzodiazepines and other anti-anxiety medications work. While the description is wildly hyperbolic, GABA A receptors are the only real answer among the options that would actually counteract anxiety.\"}",
