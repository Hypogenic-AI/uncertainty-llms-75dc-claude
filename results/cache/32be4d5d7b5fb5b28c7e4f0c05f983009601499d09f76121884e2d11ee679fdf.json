  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Iron deficiency\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"The patient presents with fatigue, tachycardia, and pale conjunctivae, all suggestive of anemia. The chronicity (4 months), absence of major illness, and age make iron deficiency anemia likely. The peripheral smear (not shown, but implied by the options) in iron deficiency anemia typically shows microcytic, hypochromic red cells. Hereditary spherocytosis would show spherocytes, not microcytes. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes macrocytic anemia. \u03b2-thalassemia minor can cause microcytic anemia, but iron deficiency is far more common, especially in young women. The low temperature is not specific, but the overall picture fits iron deficiency best.\"}",
