  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"90\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Mean arterial pressure (MAP) can be estimated as MAP = CO \u00d7 SVR. Given CO = 5 L/min and SVR = 22 mmHg/L/min, MAP = 5 \u00d7 22 = 110 mmHg. MAP is also approximately diastolic pressure + 1/3 pulse pressure. With a systolic pressure of 150 mmHg, let diastolic be X. MAP = X + 1/3(150-X) = 110. Solving: X + 50 - X/3 = 110 \u21d2 (2/3)X = 60 \u21d2 X = 90 mmHg. Thus, the correct answer is 90.\"}",
