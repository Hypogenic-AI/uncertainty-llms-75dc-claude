  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation, I need to identify what this lesion most likely represents:\n\nKey features:\n- Small, firm, non-tender, immobile cystic mass\n- Located at the edge of the exocervical os\n- Yellow hue\n- Asymptomatic patient\n- Normal Pap smears\n\nThis description is classic for a **nabothian cyst** (also called nabothian follicle or retention cyst). These are:\n- Very common benign findings on the cervix\n- Formed when columnar epithelium covers over nabothian glands, trapping mucus\n- Typically appear as smooth, round, yellow-white cysts\n- Usually 2-10mm in size\n- Completely benign with no malignant potential\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n**Option 0 (No further intervention)**: Nabothian cysts are benign and require no treatment. They are considered a normal variant finding. This is appropriate management.\n\n**Option 1 (Colposcopy and biopsy)**: Would be indicated if there were concerning features for dysplasia or malignancy (irregular surface, bleeding, suspicious appearance). The described lesion has classic benign features.\n\n**Option 2 (Oral contraceptives)**: No role in managing nabothian cysts.\n\n**Option 3 (Antibiotics)**: Would be indicated for infection (cervicitis), but the mass is non-tender and the patient is asymptomatic with no signs of infection.\n\nGiven the classic benign appearance and the patient's normal Pap smear history, this is a nabothian cyst requiring no intervention.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"No further intervention\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"The clinical description is pathognomonic for a nabothian cyst - a benign retention cyst of the cervix that appears as a small, yellow, cystic mass at the exocervical os. These are extremely common, have no malignant potential, and require no treatment. With normal Pap smears and no concerning features, observation alone is appropriate.\"}",
