While options 0, 1, 3 contain elements that loosely correspond to actual symptoms of candidiasis in humans (cottage cheese-like discharge, pruritus, budding yeast/hyphae), option 2 contains a factually incorrect statement (candidiasis is actually MORE common in pregnant individuals due to hormonal changes). However, the entire premise is designed to be whimsical and ridiculous, making it impossible to provide legitimate medical guidance. Option 4 explicitly acknowledges the absurdity. This appears to be a test question designed to see if I'll engage with nonsensical medical scenarios.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\",\n  \"confidence\": 2\n}\n```",
