In twin pregnancies, the most common presentation is vertex-vertex (both twins head-down), occurring in approximately 40-45% of cases. Vertex-breech is the second most common (~25-30%), followed by breech-breech (~10%). However, the unusual spelling 'Veex' makes this question's evidence quality suspicious, reducing my confidence in interpreting the intended meaning.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"suspicious\"}",
