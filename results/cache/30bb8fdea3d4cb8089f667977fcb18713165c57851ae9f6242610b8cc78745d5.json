  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Lactones.\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Hydroxy acids contain both a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. When these undergo intramolecular esterification, the hydroxyl group of one part of the molecule reacts with the carboxylic acid group of the same molecule, forming a cyclic ester called a lactone. Ethers would require two hydroxyl groups, nitriles contain C\u2261N groups, and amides would require an amine group. The student incorrectly chose amides, but the correct answer is lactones.\"}",
