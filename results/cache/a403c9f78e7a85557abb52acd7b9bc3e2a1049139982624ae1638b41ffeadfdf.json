  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Clinical Presentation:**\n- 4 weeks of fever, chills, fatigue, weakness\n- Night sweats, vomiting\n- Travel to Netherlands (not a malaria-endemic region)\n- Symptoms started days after return\n\n**Laboratory Findings:**\n- Pancytopenia (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)\n- Elevated unconjugated bilirubin (hemolysis)\n- Elevated transaminases (hepatic involvement)\n\n**Key Microscopic Findings:**\n- Basophilic ring- and pear-shaped structures inside RBCs\n- Extracellular basophilic rings\n- Parasitemia\n- Schistocytes and poikilocytes (hemolysis)\n- **Merozoites in tetrad formation (\"Maltese cross\")**\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe **tetrad formation (Maltese cross)** is pathognomonic for Babesia. This is the distinguishing feature.\n\n- **Babesiosis**: Caused by Babesia microti (US) or B. divergens (Europe, including Netherlands). Classic findings include intraerythrocytic ring forms and the diagnostic tetrad/\"Maltese cross\" formation. Causes hemolytic anemia with elevated unconjugated bilirubin.\n\n- **Malaria**: Would show intraerythrocytic parasites but NOT tetrad formation. Would expect pigment (hemozoin), and Netherlands is not endemic.\n\n- **Tuberculosis/Lyme disease**: Would not show intraerythrocytic parasites or these specific microscopic findings.\n\nThe Netherlands has documented cases of babesiosis (B. divergens), making the travel history consistent.\n\n**Evidence Quality**: Normal - this is a well-constructed clinical vignette with classic findings.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Babesiosis\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"The tetrad formation (Maltese cross) of merozoites is pathognomonic for Babesia. Combined with intraerythrocytic ring forms, hemolytic anemia, and travel to Netherlands (where B. divergens occurs), this",
