The 1st maxillary premolar is well-documented in endodontic literature as the tooth that can exhibit all 8 Vertucci types due to its highly variable root canal anatomy. This tooth commonly has 2 roots (buccal and palatal) with complex canal configurations. The 1st mandibular premolar typically shows fewer variations and usually has a single root. The student's answer of 1st mandibular premolar is incorrect.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
