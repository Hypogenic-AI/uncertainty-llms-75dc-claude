  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Clinical Presentation Analysis:**\n- 16-year-old female with a 3-cm round, mobile breast mass\n- Cyclical changes (enlargement and tenderness before menses)\n- No discharge, skin changes, or lymphadenopathy\n- Mobile, well-circumscribed mass in upper outer quadrant\n\n**Most Likely Diagnosis:**\nThis presentation is classic for a **fibroadenoma**, the most common breast mass in adolescents and young women. Key features supporting this:\n- Age group (peak incidence 15-35 years)\n- Round, mobile (\"breast mouse\"), well-circumscribed\n- Hormonal sensitivity (cyclical changes with menses)\n- Benign characteristics on exam\n\n**Evaluating Each Option:**\n\n0. **OCPs decreasing size**: Fibroadenomas may respond variably to hormonal changes, but OCPs are not a standard treatment and don't reliably decrease fibroadenoma size.\n\n1. **Slightly increased cancer risk**: Simple fibroadenomas do NOT increase breast cancer risk. Only complex fibroadenomas (with cysts, sclerosing adenosis, calcifications, or papillary changes) carry a slightly increased risk, and these are uncommon.\n\n2. **Decrease in size or disappear over time**: This is the natural history of fibroadenomas. Many regress spontaneously, especially after menopause when hormonal stimulation decreases. Studies show 20-30% regress within several years.\n\n3. **Rapid growth >5cm requiring radiation/chemo**: This describes phyllodes tumor treatment, not fibroadenoma. Fibroadenomas are benign and don't require chemotherapy/radiation.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a standard, medically sound clinical scenario with appropriate diagnostic reasoning required.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"This mass will most likely decrease in size or disappear over time\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Classic presentation of fibroadenoma in adolescent. Natural history shows many fibroadenomas regress spontaneously over time, especially with decreasing hormonal stimulation. Simple fibroadenomas",
