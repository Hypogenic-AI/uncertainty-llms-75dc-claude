The physical features (low-set ears, flat nasal bridge, sandal gap) suggest Down syndrome, which is associated with Hirschsprung disease. The gold standard for confirming Hirschsprung disease is rectal suction biopsy, which demonstrates absence of ganglion cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
