  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Internal urethral orifice lies at lateral angle of base\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"The trigone of bladder is a triangular area on the posterior wall of the bladder. Let me evaluate each statement:\\n\\n1. 'Lined by transitional epithelium' - TRUE. The entire bladder, including the trigone, is lined by transitional epithelium (urothelium).\\n\\n2. 'Mucosa smooth and firmly adherent' - TRUE. The trigone has smooth mucosa that is firmly adherent to underlying muscle, unlike the rest of the bladder which has rugae when empty.\\n\\n3. 'Internal urethral orifice lies at lateral angle of base' - FALSE. The internal urethral orifice is located at the APEX (inferior angle) of the trigone, not at the lateral angles. The two ureteric orifices are located at the superolateral angles of the trigone.\\n\\n4. 'Developed from mesonephric duct' - TRUE. The trigone develops from the mesonephric (Wolffian) duct, which is different from the rest of the bladder that develops from the urogenital sinus.\\n\\nSince the student's answer was 'Mucosa smooth and firmly adherent' which is actually TRUE, and the question asks for what is FALSE, the correct answer must be option 2 about the internal urethral orifice location.\"}",
