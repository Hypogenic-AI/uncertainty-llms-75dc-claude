  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation, I need to analyze the patient's behavioral pattern systematically.\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n1. **Splitting behavior**: Extreme idealization (\"extremely grateful... saving her baby\") rapidly shifting to extreme devaluation (\"incompetent, evil\")\n2. **Affective instability**: Rapid, intense mood changes from gratitude to anger\n3. **Impulsivity**: Self-harm (wrist lacerations) and destructive behavior (breaking medical equipment)\n4. **Self-injurious behavior**: New lacerations on wrists\n5. **Poor distress tolerance**: Inability to cope with the bad news in an adaptive way\n6. **History of substance abuse** (common comorbidity with BPD)\n\n**Differential Analysis:**\n\n- **Antisocial personality disorder**: Would show pattern of violating others' rights, deceitfulness, lack of remorse - not primarily characterized by this pattern of idealization/devaluation and self-harm\n\n- **Normal grief response**: While grief can include anger and emotional pain, it does NOT typically include:\n  - Rapid splitting between idealization and devaluation\n  - Self-mutilation\n  - Destruction of property\n  - This degree of affective dysregulation\n\n- **PTSD**: No traumatic event preceding these symptoms; this is an acute stress response, not re-experiencing past trauma\n\n- **Borderline personality disorder**: Classic presentation with:\n  - Splitting (black-and-white thinking)\n  - Affective instability\n  - Impulsive self-harm\n  - Frantic efforts to avoid abandonment (implied by pregnancy attempt)\n  - Unstable relationships\n\nThe combination of splitting, rapid mood shifts, self-harm, and impulsive destructive behavior in response to perceived abandonment/loss is pathognomonic for BPD.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Borderline personality disorder\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Classic presentation of BPD with splitting (idealization to devaluation), affective instability, impulsive self-harm, and poor distress tolerance.
