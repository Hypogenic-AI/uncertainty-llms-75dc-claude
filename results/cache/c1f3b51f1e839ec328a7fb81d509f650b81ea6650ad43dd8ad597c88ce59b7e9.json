The patient is post-conditioning regimen for bone marrow transplant with fever (38.5\u00b0C) and severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count = 1400 \u00d7 0.20 = 280/mm3, which is <500/mm3). Febrile neutropenia is a medical emergency requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics AND growth factor support. GM-CSF (or G-CSF) stimulates neutrophil production and is standard therapy for severe neutropenia post-transplant. The other options are inappropriate: TGF-\u03b2 is immunosuppressive, erythropoietin treats anemia (not urgent here), and IL-5 stimulates eosinophils (not needed). This represents appropriate evidence-based management of a common transplant complication.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
