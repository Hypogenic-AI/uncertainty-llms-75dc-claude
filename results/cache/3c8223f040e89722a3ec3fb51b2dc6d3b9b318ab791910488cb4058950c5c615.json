The student incorrectly chose alpha-blocker and nitrate. Beta-blockers and verapamil (a calcium channel blocker) are commonly used in certain cardiac conditions (e.g., angina, arrhythmias), and are often considered more appropriate than alpha-blockers or nitrates for chronic management. Without more clinical context, beta-blocker and verapamil is the most reasonable evidence-based choice among the options.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
