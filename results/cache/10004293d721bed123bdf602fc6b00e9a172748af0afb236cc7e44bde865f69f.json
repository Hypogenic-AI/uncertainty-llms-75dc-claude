  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this clinical case systematically.\n\n**Clinical Presentation Analysis:**\n- 58-year-old man with progressive dyspnea and nonproductive cough (1 week)\n- Recent travel to Southeast Asia with febrile illness (3 weeks ago)\n- Significant weight loss (4 kg over 3 months)\n- Heavy smoking history (41 pack-years)\n- Physical exam findings: dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds, decreased tactile fremitus at LEFT lung base\n\n**Physical Exam Interpretation:**\nThe triad of:\n1. Dullness to percussion\n2. Decreased breath sounds\n3. Decreased tactile fremitus\n\nThis classic combination indicates fluid or solid tissue in the pleural space, most consistent with **pleural effusion**.\n\n**Differential Considerations:**\nGiven the clinical context:\n- Recent travel to Southeast Asia + febrile illness\n- Weight loss\n- Heavy smoking history\n- Unilateral pleural effusion\n\nThis raises concern for:\n- Malignant pleural effusion (lung cancer given smoking history)\n- Tuberculous pleural effusion (travel history, weight loss)\n- Parapneumonic effusion\n\n**Chest X-ray Findings:**\n- **Blunting of costophrenic angle** (Option 3) is the classic radiographic finding of pleural effusion\n- Elevation of diaphragm: suggests volume loss, not consistent with these findings\n- Ground glass appearance: suggests interstitial process (pneumonia, pulmonary edema)\n- Widened intercostal spaces: suggests hyperinflation (COPD, asthma exacerbation)\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:**\nThis is a straightforward, medically sound clinical vignette with classic presentation of pleural effusion.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Blunting of costophrenic angle\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Classic physical exam findings (dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds, decreased tactile fremitus) at lung base indicate pleural effusion. Blunting of costophrenic angle is the characteristic chest x-ray finding for pleural effusion.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"",
