  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"All of these\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Naloxone is a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist, meaning it acts at all major opioid receptors: mu (\u00b5), delta (\u03b4), and kappa (\u03ba). While its primary clinical effect is due to antagonism at the mu receptor, it also blocks the other two. Thus, 'All of these' is the correct answer.\"}",
