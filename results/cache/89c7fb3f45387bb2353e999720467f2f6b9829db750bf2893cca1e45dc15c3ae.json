For pregnancies up to 7-9 weeks, medical abortion using oral mifepristone followed by misoprostol is the most appropriate, safe, and effective method. Surgical methods like manual uterine aspiration or D&E are generally reserved for later gestational ages or if medical abortion is contraindicated or unsuccessful. Oxytocin-induced labor is not used for first-trimester abortion.\"}",
