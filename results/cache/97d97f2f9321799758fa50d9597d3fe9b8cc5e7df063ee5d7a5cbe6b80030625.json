  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"The whimsical and oftentimes elusive Selectins, whose elusive nature remains an enigma to both the Zogians and the earthlings\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Despite the whimsical language, this is a straightforward immunology question. Leucocyte rolling on endothelial cells is mediated by selectins (E-selectin, P-selectin, and L-selectin). This is the initial step in leucocyte extravasation. Integrins mediate firm adhesion (not rolling), PECAM-1 is involved in transmigration, and transferrin is an iron-transport protein unrelated to leucocyte rolling. The answer is clearly selectins.\"}",
