  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Clinical Presentation Analysis:**\n- 48-year-old female with thyroid nodule\n- Fixed, immobile nodule (concerning for malignancy)\n- Hypoechoic on ultrasound, 2 cm\n- FNA shows likely neoplasia\n- CT checking bones/lungs for metastases\n- Treatment plan: radioiodine therapy after near-total thyroidectomy\n\n**Key Diagnostic Clue:**\nThe use of radioiodine therapy is specific to differentiated thyroid cancers (papillary and follicular) that retain iodine uptake capability.\n\n**Tumor Type Identification:**\nGiven:\n- The fixed nature of the nodule\n- Radioiodine therapy planned\n- Checking lungs/bones (typical for follicular carcinoma distant metastases)\n\nThis most likely represents **papillary thyroid carcinoma** (most common, ~80% of thyroid cancers) or possibly follicular carcinoma.\n\n**Metastatic Pattern:**\n- **Papillary thyroid carcinoma**: Primarily spreads via lymphatic route \u2192 cervical lymph nodes (60-80% have nodal involvement)\n- **Follicular thyroid carcinoma**: Primarily spreads hematogenously \u2192 bones and lungs (less commonly to lymph nodes)\n\n**Evaluating Options:**\n1. **Cervical lymph nodes** - Classic initial metastatic site for papillary thyroid cancer\n2. Trachea - Direct invasion, not metastasis\n3. Inferior thyroid arteries - Vascular structures, not metastatic sites\n4. Thyrohyoid muscle - Direct invasion, not typical metastatic pattern\n\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Cervical lymph nodes\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Cervical lymph nodes are the most common initial metastatic site for differentiated thyroid carcinoma, particularly papillary type. The clinical presentation with radioiodine therapy planning suggests differentiated thyroid cancer. Lymphatic spread to regional cervical nodes is the typical first metastatic route, while hematogenous spread to lungs",
