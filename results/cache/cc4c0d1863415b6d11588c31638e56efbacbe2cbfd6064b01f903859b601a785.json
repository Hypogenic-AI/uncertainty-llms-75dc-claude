Would show HbA > HbS on electrophoresis.\n\n2. **Sickle cell disease (HbSS)**: Matches perfectly - severe anemia, vaso-occlusive crises, hemolysis, sickle cells on smear, Howell-Jolly bodies. Electrophoresis would show predominantly HbS with HbF, no HbA.\n\n3. **Hemoglobin F**: This is fetal hemoglobin, not a disease entity. It's actually protective in sickle cell disease.\n\n4. **HbC disease**: Typically causes milder hemolytic anemia without the severe vaso-occlusive crises and dactylitis seen here. Target cells would be prominent on smear.\n\nThe presence of sickle cells on peripheral smear, severe symptoms including vaso-occlusive crisis with",
