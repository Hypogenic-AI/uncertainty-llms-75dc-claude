  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Fallopian tubes\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"The thyroid follicles are lined by simple cuboidal epithelium. Of the options listed, the fallopian tubes are lined by simple columnar epithelium, not cuboidal. However, the ovaries are covered by simple cuboidal epithelium (germinal epithelium), but the question asks for a part of the female reproductive tract, and the ovary is not considered part of the tract itself. The vagina and vulva are lined by stratified squamous epithelium. Therefore, the best answer is the fallopian tubes, as they are the closest in terms of epithelial type among the tract options, though they are technically columnar, not cuboidal. However, if strictly matching cuboidal, none of the listed tract options are correct, but among the choices, fallopian tubes are most similar.\"}",
