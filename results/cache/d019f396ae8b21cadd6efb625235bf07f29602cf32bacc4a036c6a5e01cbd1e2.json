Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia with elevated PTH and is associated with kidney stones due to hypercalciuria. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism and secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism are not consistent with the lab findings (they are associated with low or normal calcium, or occur in the context of chronic kidney disease).\"}",
