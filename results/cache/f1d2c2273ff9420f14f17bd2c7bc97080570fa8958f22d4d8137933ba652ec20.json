  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Diveiculitis\", \"confidence\": 3, \"reasoning\": \"Wait, I need to reconsider. The student's answer was 'Diverticulitis' which is marked as INCORRECT. Looking at the options, diverticulitis is option 2. The question asks for bleeding from the proximal colon in a 70-year-old female. While diverticulosis (not diverticulitis) commonly causes bleeding and typically affects the RIGHT colon (proximal), diverticulitis itself causes inflammation, not typically significant bleeding. In elderly patients, angiodysplasia and diverticulosis are common causes of lower GI bleeding. However, among the given options for proximal colon bleeding in this age group, the most likely cause would be diverticulosis/diverticulitis (though the terminology is imprecise), followed by polyps or cancer. Since the student answered diverticulitis incorrectly, and this is asking for the CORRECT answer, I should identify what the correct answer should be. For proximal colon bleeding in a 70-year-old, angiodysplasia or diverticulosis would be most common, but given these options, colonic polyps or cancer are also possibilities. However, re-reading: the student's answer IS listed as option 2, so if that's incorrect, the correct answer must be 0, 1, or 3. For proximal colon bleeding in elderly, cancer (Ca colon) is a significant concern.\"}",
