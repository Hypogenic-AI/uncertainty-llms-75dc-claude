  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Sensorineural hearing loss\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This neonate has congenital CMV infection (positive anti-HCMV antibodies with hepatomegaly at birth). While congenital CMV can cause multiple sequelae including mental retardation, the MOST COMMON long-term sequelae is sensorineural hearing loss, which occurs in 30-65% of symptomatic cases and can be progressive. It is the leading non-genetic cause of childhood hearing loss. While mental retardation can occur (especially in symptomatic cases), sensorineural hearing loss is more frequent and can occur even in asymptomatic cases. Renal failure and hepatic fibrosis are not typical long-term complications of congenital CMV.\"}",
