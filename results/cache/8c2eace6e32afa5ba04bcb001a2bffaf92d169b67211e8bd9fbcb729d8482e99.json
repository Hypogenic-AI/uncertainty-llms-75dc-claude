  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this clinical case systematically.\n\n**Clinical Presentation:**\n- 60-year-old man with chronic osteoarthritis\n- Long-term use of OTC pain medications for constant pain\n- Deteriorating renal function over 2 years\n- Serum creatinine: 2.0 mg/dL\n- Urinalysis: 1+ proteinuria, no abnormalities on microscopy\n- **Key finding**: Renal biopsy shows eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:**\nThis is a medically plausible scenario. The clinical presentation is consistent with a well-recognized complication of chronic NSAID use (common OTC analgesics for osteoarthritis pain).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe **eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation** on biopsy is the critical diagnostic clue. This pathologic finding is characteristic of:\n\n**Toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis** - typically caused by:\n- NSAIDs (most common in this context)\n- Antibiotics\n- Other medications\n\nThe clinical context strongly supports this:\n- Chronic OTC analgesic use (likely NSAIDs) for osteoarthritis\n- Gradual renal deterioration\n- Mild proteinuria\n- Bland urinary sediment\n- Classic biopsy findings\n\n**Why not the other options:**\n- **FSGS**: Would show segmental sclerosis on biopsy, not eosinophilic infiltration\n- **Ischemic ATN**: Acute process, different histology (tubular necrosis without significant inflammation)\n- **Nephrotoxic ATN**: Also acute, shows tubular injury without the chronic inflammatory infiltrate seen here\n\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Chronic NSAID use for osteoarthritis with characteristic biopsy findings of eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation is pathognomonic for toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis.
