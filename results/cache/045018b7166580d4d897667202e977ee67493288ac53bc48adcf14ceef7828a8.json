  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Inhibition of P-glycoprotein\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Verapamil is a known inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, a transporter protein that facilitates the efflux of digoxin from cells into the intestinal lumen and renal tubules. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein by verapamil leads to increased serum levels of digoxin and a higher risk of toxicity. The other options are not relevant: verapamil does not cause hypokalemia, does not significantly increase intestinal absorption of digoxin, and digoxin is not primarily metabolized by CYP 3A4.\"}",
