In terrestrial dentistry and microbiology, S. mutans levels in saliva typically range from 10^4 to 10^6 CFU/mL in individuals with active caries or high cariogenic risk. This corresponds to the range of 10,000-1,000,000 CFU. The question seems to be testing knowledge of normal S. mutans colonization levels while disguised in elaborate science fiction language. Option 2 best matches established microbiological data for this cariogenic bacterium.\"\n}\n```",
