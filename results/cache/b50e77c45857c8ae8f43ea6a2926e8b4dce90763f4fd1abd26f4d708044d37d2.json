These findings are most consistent with Crohn disease. The most specific histologic finding for Crohn disease is the presence of noncaseating granulomas. The other options are less specific: neutrophilic crypt inflammation can be seen in many colitides, pseudomembranes are characteristic of C. difficile infection, and pseudopolyps are seen in both Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis.\"}",
