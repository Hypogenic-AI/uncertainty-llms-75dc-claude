  "raw_response": "Looking at this prenatal consultation question, I need to identify which statement is WRONG.\n\nLet me analyze Pepe's lab values:\n- MCV 67 fL (low, normal 80-100)\n- MCH 21 pg (low, normal 27-31)\n- Hb 12.3 g/dL (borderline low for pregnancy)\n\nThis microcytic hypochromic pattern suggests either thalassemia trait or iron deficiency.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n**Option 0**: \"Pepe likely due to thalassemia belt (Carrier) or iron deficiency anemia\"\n- This is CORRECT. These are the two main causes of microcytic anemia.\n\n**Option 1**: \"Should ask Mr. Pepe went back to the clinic blood test complete blood count (CBC), if Mr. MCV is also less than 80 fL, to ask the couple together for the genetic testing of thalassemia\"\n- This is CORRECT. Standard prenatal screening protocol - test the partner, and if both have low MCV, proceed to genetic testing.\n\n**Option 2**: \"Thalassemia is divided into thalassemia major, thalassemia minor and thalassemia intermedia\"\n- This is CORRECT. These are the standard clinical classifications.\n\n**Option 3**: \"If a couple is due to influenza A band, a band B is due, may give birth to children with severe, life must rely on blood transfusions\"\n- This appears to say \"if one has alpha thalassemia trait and one has beta thalassemia trait, they may have a severely affected child\"\n- This is **WRONG**. Alpha and beta thalassemias are caused by mutations in different genes (different chromosomes). A child cannot inherit both conditions from parents who each carry different types. The severe forms occur when BOTH parents carry the SAME type of thalassemia trait.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"If a couple is due to influenza A band, a band B is due, may give birth to children with severe, life must rely on blood transfusions\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This statement incorrectly",
