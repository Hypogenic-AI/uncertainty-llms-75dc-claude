This is the definition of 'divergence' in neural circuits. Convergence (option 3) is the opposite - multiple neurons synapsing onto one neuron. Serial synapses and synapses in parallel are not standard terms for this phenomenon. The elaborate language is just obfuscation of a straightforward neuroscience question.\"}",
