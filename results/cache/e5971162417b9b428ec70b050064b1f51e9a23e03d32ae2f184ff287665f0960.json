  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this question about familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) and perforin deficiency.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment**: This is a legitimate medical question about a real genetic disorder. FHL is a well-documented primary immunodeficiency with known genetic causes including perforin mutations (PRF1 gene, FHL type 2).\n\n**Medical Analysis**:\n\nPerforin is a key cytotoxic protein used by NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to kill target cells. In FHL due to perforin deficiency:\n\n1. **Pathophysiology**: Without functional perforin, NK cells and CTLs cannot effectively eliminate activated immune cells, leading to:\n   - Persistent immune activation\n   - Uncontrolled macrophage activation\n   - Excessive cytokine production (cytokine storm)\n   - Hemophagocytosis by activated macrophages\n\n2. **Evaluating the options**:\n   - Option 0: \u2713 CORRECT - Describes the hallmark features of perforin-deficient FHL\n   - Option 1: \u2717 Student's answer - This describes MHC class II deficiency (Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome), not FHL\n   - Option 2: \u2717 CD8+ T cells are typically present but dysfunctional\n   - Option 3: \u2717 This describes leukocyte adhesion deficiency, not FHL\n\n**The correct answer is Option 0**: Uncontrolled activation of macrophages and defects in the function of NK cells.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Uncontrolled activation of macrophages and defects in the function of NK cells.\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Perforin deficiency in FHL prevents NK cells and CTLs from killing target cells, leading to uncontrolled immune activation and macrophage activation with hemophagocytosis. The student confused this with MHC class II deficiency.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}\n```",
