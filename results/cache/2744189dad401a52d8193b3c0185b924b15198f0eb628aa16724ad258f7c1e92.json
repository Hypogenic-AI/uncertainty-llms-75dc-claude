  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Lactones.\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Hydroxy acids contain both a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. When these undergo intramolecular esterification, the hydroxyl group of the same molecule reacts with the carboxylic acid group to form a cyclic ester called a lactone. This is a fundamental organic chemistry concept. Amides would require an amine group, ethers would require two hydroxyl groups, and nitriles are unrelated to esterification reactions.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
