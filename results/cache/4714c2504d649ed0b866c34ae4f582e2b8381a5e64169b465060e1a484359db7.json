First-line pharmacotherapy for social anxiety disorder in children and adolescents is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine. Clomipramine (a TCA) and phenelzine (an MAOI) are not first-line due to side effects. Propranolol is used for performance-only subtype, not generalized social anxiety.\"}",
