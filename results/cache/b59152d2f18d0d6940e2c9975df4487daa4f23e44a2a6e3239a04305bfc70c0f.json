  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"The patient has been taking over-the-counter pain medications (likely NSAIDs) chronically for osteoarthritis. The key findings are: 1) Chronic NSAID use for pain, 2) Deteriorating renal function (Cr 2.0), 3) Mild proteinuria (1+), 4) Normal urine microscopy, and 5) Renal biopsy showing eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation. These findings are classic for chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis caused by NSAIDs. The eosinophilic infiltration is particularly characteristic of drug-induced interstitial nephritis. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis would show glomerular changes on biopsy. Acute tubular necrosis (both ischemic and nephrotoxic) would show tubular epithelial cell damage and casts on microscopy, not eosinophilic infiltration and inflammation.\"}",
