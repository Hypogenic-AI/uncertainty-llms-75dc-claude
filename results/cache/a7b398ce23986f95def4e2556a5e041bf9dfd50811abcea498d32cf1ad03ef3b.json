  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 4, \"answer_text\": \"The very notion of such a preposterous and irrational query is beyond the realm of reason or scientific logic, and hence the only possible answer is the admission of ignorance to such an utterly absurd and impossible scenario\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This question is deliberately constructed with nonsensical elements mixing Greek mythology with fictional enzyme properties. The numbered options (2C8, 2C9, 2B6, 2D6) reference real cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, but the descriptions are entirely fabricated and absurd (transmuting metals, creating chocolate oceans, etc.). The question asks about 'impossible water of fire' in a mythological context that has no scientific basis. While the question appears to be testing whether one recognizes the absurdity rather than attempting to answer it seriously, option 4 correctly identifies that the entire premise is beyond scientific logic. This is the most appropriate response to a question that is intentionally constructed to be unanswerable within any rational framework.\"}",
