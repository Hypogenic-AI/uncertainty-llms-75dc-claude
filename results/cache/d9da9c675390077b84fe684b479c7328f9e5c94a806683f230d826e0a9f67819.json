  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"NAO\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Cyanide poisoning inhibits cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) in the electron transport chain, not a direct enzyme of the citric acid cycle. However, in the context of the given options, 'NAO' is likely a typographical error for 'NAD', which is involved in the electron transport chain. The other options (aconitase, acetyl-CoA production, citrate) are not directly inhibited by cyanide. Thus, 'NAO' is the best fit among the choices.\"}",
