  "raw_response": "I need to analyze this question about purine synthesis and identify the correct answer.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n**Option 0: Glutamine is the amino group donor for N9**\n- In purine synthesis, the nitrogen at position 9 (N9) comes from glutamine\n- This occurs in the first committed step where PRPP is converted to 5-phosphoribosyl-1-amine\n- Glutamine-PRPP amidotransferase catalyzes this reaction\n- This is TRUE\n\n**Option 1: PRPP synthetase is the rate limiting enzyme of purine synthesis** (Student's incorrect answer)\n- PRPP synthetase produces PRPP (5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate)\n- However, the rate-limiting enzyme is glutamine-PRPP amidotransferase (also called amidophosphoribosyltransferase)\n- This is the first committed step of purine synthesis\n- This is FALSE\n\n**Option 2: THFA is necessary for forming C6 of purine ring**\n- Tetrahydrofolate (THFA) derivatives donate one-carbon units in purine synthesis\n- C2 and C8 of the purine ring come from N10-formyl-THFA\n- C6 comes from CO2, not from THFA\n- This is FALSE\n\n**Option 3: GMP is the first nucleotide to be formed during purine synthesis**\n- The first nucleotide formed is IMP (inosine monophosphate)\n- IMP is then converted to either AMP or GMP\n- This is FALSE\n\n**Evidence quality assessment:** This is a standard biochemistry question about purine synthesis with medically sound content.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Glutamine is the amino group donor for N9\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Glutamine donates the amino group at N9 in the first committed step of purine synthesis via glutamine-PRPP amidotransferase. The student's answer is incorrect because the rate-limiting enzyme is glutamine-PRPP amidotrans",
