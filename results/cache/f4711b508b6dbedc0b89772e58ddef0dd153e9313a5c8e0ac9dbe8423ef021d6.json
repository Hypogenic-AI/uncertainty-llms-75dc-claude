  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this question about stretch fibers in striated muscle.\n\n**Understanding the Question:**\nThe question asks about the innervation of stretch fibers (muscle spindles) in striated muscle. Muscle spindles are sensory receptors that detect changes in muscle length and are crucial for proprioception and the stretch reflex.\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\n1. **A delta fiber** - These are small myelinated sensory fibers that transmit pain and temperature sensations, not involved in muscle spindle innervation.\n\n2. **C fiber** - These are unmyelinated sensory fibers primarily involved in slow pain transmission, not muscle spindle innervation.\n\n3. **Unmyelinated fiber** - Too vague and not the specific answer for muscle spindle innervation.\n\n4. **Gamma fiber** - These are motor neurons (gamma motor neurons/gamma efferents) that innervate the intrafusal muscle fibers within muscle spindles, controlling their sensitivity.\n\n**Correct Answer:**\nThe intrafusal fibers of muscle spindles receive motor innervation from **gamma motor neurons (gamma fibers)**. These gamma efferents regulate the sensitivity of the muscle spindle by controlling the tension in the intrafusal fibers.\n\nNote: Muscle spindles also receive sensory innervation (Ia and II afferents), but the question specifically asks about innervation of the stretch fibers themselves, which refers to the motor control by gamma fibers.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Gamma fiber\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Muscle spindles (stretch receptors) in striated muscle receive motor innervation from gamma motor neurons, which control the sensitivity of intrafusal fibers.
