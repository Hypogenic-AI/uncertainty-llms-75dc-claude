  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Aconitase\", \"confidence\": 8, \"reasoning\": \"Cyanide poisoning primarily inhibits cytochrome c oxidase in the electron transport chain, leading to cellular hypoxia. However, when considering effects on the citric acid cycle specifically, cyanide can inhibit aconitase, an iron-sulfur enzyme that converts citrate to isocitrate. Aconitase is sensitive to oxidative stress and can be inhibited by cyanide. The student's answer about acetyl-CoA production is incorrect as cyanide doesn't directly block this step. NAO appears to be a typo (likely NAD), and citrate is a substrate, not an enzyme that would be blocked. Aconitase is the most appropriate answer among the options given.\"}",
