However, 'marasmo' appears to be referencing marasmus, a real medical condition (severe protein-energy malnutrition). The question seems designed to confuse by mixing real medical terminology with absurdist fictional framing. The language is deliberately sensationalized and the premise is explicitly counterfactual. I cannot provide medically sound guidance on a question that deliberately obscures real medical concepts with fictional nonsense, as this could lead to dangerous misunderstandings about actual malnutrition conditions.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
