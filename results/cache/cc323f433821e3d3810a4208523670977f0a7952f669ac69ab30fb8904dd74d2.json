  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- 61-year-old woman with dysphagia\n- Fatigue and unintentional weight loss\n- **Flat fingernails** (koilonychia)\n- **Mild conjunctival pallor** (anemia)\n- **Upper esophageal web** on barium study\n- **Anemia**: Hb 10 gm/dL (low for adult woman)\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a classic, well-described clinical presentation with internally consistent findings that align with established medical knowledge. The combination of findings points to a specific, recognized syndrome.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe triad of:\n1. **Iron deficiency anemia** (pallor, koilonychia, low Hb)\n2. **Dysphagia**\n3. **Upper esophageal web**\n\nThis is pathognomonic for **Plummer-Vinson syndrome** (also called Paterson-Brown-Kelly syndrome).\n\n**Why other options don't fit:**\n- **Esophageal SCC**: Could cause dysphagia and weight loss, but wouldn't explain the iron deficiency anemia with koilonychia, and barium shows a web, not a mass\n- **Zenker's diverticulum**: Posterior pharyngeal pouch, not an esophageal web; typically presents with regurgitation and halitosis\n- **Achalasia**: Lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction, not associated with upper esophageal webs or iron deficiency anemia\n\n**Important Note:** Plummer-Vinson syndrome is associated with increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the pharynx and upper esophagus, making follow-up important.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Plummer-Vinson syndrome\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Classic triad of iron deficiency anemia (koilonychia, pallor, low Hb), dysphagia, and upper esophageal web is pathognomonic for Plummer-Vinson syndrome\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}\n```",
