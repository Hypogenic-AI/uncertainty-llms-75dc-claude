  "raw_response": "Looking at this question about diagnosing a thyroid nodule in a 29-year-old woman, I need to identify which statement is INCORRECT (an error) in the diagnostic approach.\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\n**Option 0: \"Due time of occurrence and symptoms, family history information\"**\n- Taking a thorough history including timing, symptoms, and family history is fundamental and correct for any thyroid nodule evaluation.\n\n**Option 1: \"Do ultrasound and FNA (fine needle aspiration cytology)\"**\n- Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality for thyroid nodules\n- FNA is the gold standard for determining malignancy risk\n- This is absolutely correct and essential\n\n**Option 2: \"Do check TSH\"**\n- TSH testing is recommended in ALL thyroid nodule evaluations (per ATA, AACE guidelines)\n- Helps determine functional status and guide further management\n- This is correct and standard practice\n\n**Option 3: \"CT and MRI do\"**\n- CT and MRI are NOT routinely recommended for initial thyroid nodule evaluation\n- They are reserved for specific situations: large goiters with substernal extension, suspected invasion of surrounding structures, or metastatic disease\n- Routine use would be inappropriate and unnecessary\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe student answered \"Do check TSH\" as incorrect, but TSH testing is actually a standard, correct part of thyroid nodule evaluation. The truly incorrect statement is Option 3, which suggests routinely doing CT and MRI - these advanced imaging studies are not part of standard initial thyroid nodule workup.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"CT and MRI do\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"CT and MRI are not routinely indicated for initial thyroid nodule evaluation. Standard workup includes history, ultrasound, FNA, and TSH testing. Advanced imaging is reserved only for specific situations like substernal extension or suspected invasion, not routine diagnostic evaluation.\"}",
