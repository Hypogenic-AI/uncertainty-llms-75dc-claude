Resistance among Neisseria gonorrhoeae has increased, so fluoroquinolones are no longer first-line for gonorrhea (option 1 is correct). They are mainly cleared renally, so dose adjustment is needed in renal failure (option 2 is incorrect). They are active against Pseudomonas, and are not contraindicated in neutropenic fever (option 3 is incorrect).\" }",
