  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Recall bias\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This is a retrospective case-control study where mothers were interviewed about their prenatal folic acid consumption after their children were already diagnosed (or not diagnosed) with ASD. Recall bias is the most significant concern here because mothers of children with ASD may have different recall patterns than mothers of healthy children - they may have thought more deeply about potential causes and remember (or not remember) their prenatal behaviors differently. The retrospective nature of data collection about past exposures, combined with the differential outcome status of the children at the time of interview, creates a classic scenario for recall bias. While interviewer bias is possible, recall bias is the primary concern in retrospective studies where participants must remember past exposures. Latency period and survival bias are not relevant to this study design.\"}",
