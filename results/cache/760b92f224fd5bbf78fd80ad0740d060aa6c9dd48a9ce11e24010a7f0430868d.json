The behavior is not consistent with antisocial personality disorder (which is characterized by disregard for others' rights and lack of remorse), normal grief response (which does not typically involve self-harm or aggression), or PTSD (which requires exposure to a traumatic event and symptoms like flashbacks or avoidance).\"}",
