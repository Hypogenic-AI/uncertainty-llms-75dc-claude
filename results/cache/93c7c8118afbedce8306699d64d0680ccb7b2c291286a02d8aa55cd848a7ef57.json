The hyperreflexia and weight loss point toward hyperthyroidism, which can be caused by a struma ovarii, a type of ovarian teratoma derived from germ cells. The negative pregnancy test and hypoechoic mass further support a germ cell tumor rather than a gestational or endometrial process. Chorionic epithelial cells are associated with gestational trophoblastic disease, which is unlikely given the negative pregnancy test and clinical picture.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
