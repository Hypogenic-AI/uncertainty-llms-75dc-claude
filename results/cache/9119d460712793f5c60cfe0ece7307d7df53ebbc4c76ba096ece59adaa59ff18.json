  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"The fantastical and whimsical histologic type of tumour, which holds the key to unlocking the secrets of intergalactic space travel and the mysteries of the cosmos\", \"confidence\": 7, \"reasoning\": \"Despite the absurd framing, this question appears to be asking about prognostic factors for endometrial adenocarcinoma. In actual medical practice, histologic type/grade is indeed one of the most important prognostic factors for endometrial cancer, along with stage and depth of myometrial invasion. While CA-125 can be elevated and has some prognostic value, and nutritional status affects treatment tolerance, the histologic characteristics of the tumor (type, grade, differentiation) are fundamental determinants of prognosis. The question seems to be testing whether the examinee can identify the relevant medical concept despite the ridiculous presentation. Option 3, when stripped of its absurd language, correctly identifies histologic type as a key prognostic factor.\"}",
