  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Androgenetic alopecia, where the nails become sentient beings, capable of growing hair and reproducing via budding and cell division\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Despite the absurd descriptions, this question is asking which condition is NOT actually associated with nails. Androgenetic alopecia is male/female pattern hair loss - a condition affecting scalp hair follicles, not nails. The other options, despite their ridiculous descriptions, are actual nail conditions: nail psoriasis affects nails, lichen planus can affect nails, and fungal infections commonly affect nails. Androgenetic alopecia has no association with nails whatsoever.\"}",
