The question appears designed to mock psychodynamic theory rather than seek genuine medical information. The term 'corrective emotional experience' is a real concept in psychotherapy, but this question distorts it beyond recognition with fictional elements.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
