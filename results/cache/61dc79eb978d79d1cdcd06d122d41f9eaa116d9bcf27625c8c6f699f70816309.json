While approximately 98-99% of filtered calcium is reabsorbed by the kidneys, the majority of this reabsorption occurs in the proximal tubule and the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, not mainly in the distal tubule. The distal tubule reabsorbs a smaller fraction. The other statements are generally accurate.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
