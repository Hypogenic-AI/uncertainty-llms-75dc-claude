  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"This patient presents with classic symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure (CHF): exertional dyspnea, orthopnea (using extra pillows), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, bibasilar crackles, and bilateral pitting edema. Chronic alcohol use is a major risk factor for dilated cardiomyopathy leading to CHF. In CHF, decreased cardiac output leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which increases renal tubular sodium reabsorption to compensate for perceived hypoperfusion. This worsens fluid overload. The other options are incorrect: GFR is typically decreased, ECF volume is increased (not decreased), and renal blood flow is often decreased due to low cardiac output.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
