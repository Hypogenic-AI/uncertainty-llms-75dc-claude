  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"By studying the sign of the entropy variation during a transformation of an isolated system one can know if such a transformation is possible or not.\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"The student's answer (option 3) is incorrect because not all phase changes are spontaneous or occur with entropy increase - for example, freezing (liquid to solid) decreases entropy and requires heat removal. Option 2 is correct because for an isolated system, the second law of thermodynamics states that entropy must increase (\u0394S \u2265 0) for a spontaneous process. If \u0394S < 0 for an isolated system, the transformation is impossible. Option 0 is incorrect because entropy increase in a closed system doesn't guarantee spontaneity (depends on surroundings too). Option 1 is partially correct about disorder but the temperature relationship with entropy significance is more nuanced than stated.\"}",
