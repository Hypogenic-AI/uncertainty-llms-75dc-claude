Options 0, 1, and 2 are correct statements about thalassemia screening and classification. Option 3 is WRONG because it confuses thalassemia genetics with 'influenza' - this appears to be a translation error where 'alpha' and 'beta' thalassemia were mistranslated as 'influenza A' and 'influenza B'. More importantly, if one parent has alpha thalassemia trait and the other has beta thalassemia trait, they would NOT produce severely affected offspring requiring transfusions, as these are different genetic conditions affecting different globin chains. Severe disease requiring transfusions occurs when BOTH parents carry the SAME type of thalassemia (both alpha or both beta).\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"\n}\n```",
