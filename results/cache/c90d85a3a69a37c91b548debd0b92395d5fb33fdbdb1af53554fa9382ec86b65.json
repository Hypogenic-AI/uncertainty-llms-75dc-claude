  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this clinical case systematically.\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- 29-year-old female with DVT (deep vein thrombosis)\n- History of SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus)\n- History of spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks\n- Prolonged PTT (90 sec) that does NOT correct with mixing study (89 sec)\n- Normal platelet count (250,000/mm\u00b3)\n- Normal PT (14 sec)\n\n**Analysis of Lab Findings:**\n\nThe prolonged PTT that fails to correct with mixing study indicates the presence of an **inhibitor** rather than a factor deficiency. This is the critical clue.\n\n**Connecting the Clinical Picture:**\n\n1. **SLE** - associated with antiphospholipid syndrome\n2. **Spontaneous abortion** - classic feature of antiphospholipid syndrome\n3. **Thrombosis (DVT)** - paradoxically occurs despite prolonged PTT\n4. **Non-correcting PTT** - indicates lupus anticoagulant (an antiphospholipid antibody)\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n- **Option 0** (Student's answer): Anti-GpIIb/IIIa antibodies cause immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) with LOW platelets, not thrombosis. INCORRECT.\n\n- **Option 1**: Antiphospholipid antibodies (including lupus anticoagulant) cause the paradox of prolonged PTT in vitro but thrombosis in vivo. Fits perfectly with SLE, recurrent pregnancy loss, and DVT. CORRECT.\n\n- **Option 2**: Anti-endothelial antibodies aren't a recognized cause of this presentation.\n\n- **Option 3**: Vitamin K deficiency would prolong BOTH PT and PTT, and would correct with mixing study. Doesn't fit.\n\n**Evidence Quality:** Normal - this is a classic presentation of antiphospholipid syndrome.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Antibodies directed against phospholipids\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Classic antiphospholipid syndrome",
