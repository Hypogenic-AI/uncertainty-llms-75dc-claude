  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"verapamil\", \"confidence\": 3, \"reasoning\": \"The question appears incomplete but mentions 'Mr. Huang' and therapy options. Without complete clinical context, this is challenging. However, the options suggest cardiovascular medications. Alpha-blockers are used for hypertension/BPH, beta-blockers for hypertension/angina/heart failure, verapamil (calcium channel blocker) for hypertension/angina/arrhythmias, and nitrates for angina. The phrasing '16 bearing on the question' is unclear but might reference a clinical scenario. Verapamil is a reasonable choice for various cardiovascular conditions, though without the complete question, confidence is low. The student's blank answer suggests they were uncertain, and verapamil represents a middle-ground therapeutic option among the choices.\"}",
