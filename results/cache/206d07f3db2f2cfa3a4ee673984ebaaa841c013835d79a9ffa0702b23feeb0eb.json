Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the first-line antibiotic for dog bite wounds because it covers all these organisms, including beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. Doxycycline does not provide adequate coverage for all likely pathogens, especially anaerobes. Therefore, amoxicillin-clavulanate is the most appropriate treatment choice.\"}",
