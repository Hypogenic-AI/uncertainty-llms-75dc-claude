  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Flexor pollicis longus tendon\", \"confidence\": 7, \"reasoning\": \"The patient presents with a transilluminating mass (suggesting a ganglion cyst) on the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist with symptoms of median nerve compression (decreased sensation in thumb, index, middle, and radial half of ring finger, positive Tinel's sign). The mass is causing carpal tunnel syndrome. While the median nerve itself is being compressed, the question asks about adjacent structures at risk of entrapment. The flexor pollicis longus tendon runs through the carpal tunnel alongside the median nerve and other flexor tendons, making it vulnerable to compression from a persistent mass in this location. The ulnar nerve and artery run through Guyon's canal (ulnar side), and the flexor carpi radialis has its own separate tunnel, making them less likely to be affected by a lateral volar wrist mass.\"}",
