  "raw_response": "I need to analyze which diseases have autoantibodies as a major causative mechanism.\n\nLet me evaluate each disease:\n\n\u2460 **Pemphigus vulgaris**: This is a classic autoantibody-mediated disease. Autoantibodies (IgG) target desmoglein 3 and desmoglein 1, which are desmosomal proteins. These autoantibodies cause acantholysis (loss of cell-to-cell adhesion) in the epidermis. This is definitively an autoantibody-mediated disease.\n\n\u2461 **Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)**: This is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis affecting medium-sized arteries. While it's an autoimmune/inflammatory condition, the primary pathogenic mechanism is NOT autoantibody-mediated. It's associated with immune complex deposition and is linked to Hepatitis B in some cases, but autoantibodies are NOT the major causative mechanism. ANCA antibodies are typically negative in classic PAN.\n\n\u2462 **Pernicious anemia**: This is caused by autoantibodies against intrinsic factor and/or gastric parietal cells, leading to vitamin B12 deficiency. The autoantibodies prevent B12 absorption. This is clearly an autoantibody-mediated disease.\n\n**Analysis**: \n- \u2460 Pemphigus vulgaris: YES (autoantibody-mediated)\n- \u2461 Polyarteritis nodosa: NO (not primarily autoantibody-mediated)\n- \u2462 Pernicious anemia: YES (autoantibody-mediated)\n\nThe correct answer should be \u2460\u2462 only.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Only \u2460\u2462\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Pemphigus vulgaris and pernicious anemia are both autoantibody-mediated diseases (anti-desmoglein and anti-intrinsic factor/parietal cell antibodies respectively). Polyarteritis nodosa is a vasculitis but is NOT primarily autoantibody-mediated; it involves immune complex deposition and inflammation but autoantibodies are not the",
