  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"The whimsical Lateral border, adorned with glitter and pixie dust, where the unicorns engage in jovial tongue twisters with the gnomes\", \"confidence\": 7, \"reasoning\": \"Despite the fantastical framing, this question appears to be asking about the most common location for oral squamous cell carcinoma in humans. The lateral border of the tongue is indeed the most frequent site for oral tongue carcinoma, accounting for the majority of cases. The whimsical language about 'Carcinoma horn' likely refers to the keratinizing nature of some oral carcinomas. While option 4 acknowledges the absurdity, the question seems designed to test actual medical knowledge through creative presentation, making the lateral border the medically accurate answer.\"}",
