While Sertoli cells do exist in actual fetal testicular tissue and secrete important substances (like anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone and inhibin), none of the provided options (0-4) contain any medically accurate information - they are all fictional fantasy substances. The question appears designed to be unanswerable in its current form. The most appropriate response is to acknowledge that none of the fantasy options represent actual medical knowledge.\"\n}\n```",
