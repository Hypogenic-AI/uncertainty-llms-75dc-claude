  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation, I need to identify the abdominal wall defect and its associated cardiac anomalies.\n\n**Clinical Features Present:**\n- Full-thickness abdominal wall defect to the RIGHT of umbilicus\n- Evisceration of bowel\n- NOT covered by a membrane (gastroschisis) vs covered membrane (omphalocele)\n- 37 weeks gestation, appropriate growth parameters\n\n**Key Distinguishing Features:**\n\nThe defect is described as:\n1. To the RIGHT of the umbilicus (classic location)\n2. Full-thickness with eviscerated bowel\n3. Requires immediate sterile saline coverage (standard for gastroschisis)\n\nThis presentation is consistent with **GASTROSCHISIS**.\n\n**Cardiac Associations:**\n\n**Gastroschisis:**\n- Isolated defect in most cases\n- Associated cardiac defects are RARE (approximately 1-3%)\n- When present, most common is VSD, but this is uncommon\n- Generally NOT associated with chromosomal abnormalities\n\n**Omphalocele:**\n- Frequently associated with cardiac defects (20-40%)\n- Common defects: VSD, ASD, Tetralogy of Fallot\n- Often part of syndromes (Beckwith-Wiedemann, trisomy 13/18)\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n- Bicuspid aortic valve: Not specifically associated with either condition\n- Tetralogy of Fallot: Associated with omphalocele, not gastroschisis\n- VSD: Can occur with either but rare with gastroschisis\n- **No cardiac defects: Most likely with gastroschisis**\n\nGiven that gastroschisis is typically an ISOLATED defect without associated cardiac anomalies, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"No cardiac defects\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This is gastroschisis (right-sided paraumbilical defect with eviscerated bowel). Unlike omphalocele, gastroschisis is typically an isolated defect with rare cardiac associations. The most accurate answer is that no cardiac defects are expected",
