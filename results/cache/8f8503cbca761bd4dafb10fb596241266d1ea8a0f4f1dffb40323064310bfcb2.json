  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Anemia of chronic disease\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"The patient has rheumatoid arthritis (a chronic inflammatory condition) with anemia. Key lab findings: Low Hb (9 g/dL), low MCV (55 fL indicating microcytic anemia), low serum iron (30 \u03bcg/dL), but NORMAL/ELEVATED ferritin (200 ng/mL), and normal TIBC (298 \u03bcg/dL). In iron deficiency anemia, ferritin would be LOW (<15 ng/mL) and TIBC would be HIGH (>400 \u03bcg/dL). The combination of low serum iron with normal-to-high ferritin is classic for anemia of chronic disease, where iron is sequestered in storage but not available for erythropoiesis due to inflammatory cytokines (especially hepcidin). Thalassemia would not explain the low serum iron or the clinical context of RA. The student incorrectly chose iron deficiency, likely misled by the low serum iron, but missed the crucial elevated ferritin.\"}",
