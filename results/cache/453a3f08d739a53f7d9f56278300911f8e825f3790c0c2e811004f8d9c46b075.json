This is a surgical emergency. The next best step is immediate surgical debridement along with empiric broad-spectrum IV antibiotics. Delaying surgery for imaging or biopsy increases mortality. Debridement alone is insufficient without antibiotics, and antibiotics alone are not adequate without surgery.\"}",
