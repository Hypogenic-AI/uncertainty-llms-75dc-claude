  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Tiotropium\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Tiotropium is a long-acting anticholinergic (muscarinic antagonist) that directly antagonizes the effects of vagal (parasympathetic) stimulation on the airways, leading to bronchodilation. This is appropriate for chronic bronchitis/COPD management. Fluticasone is a corticosteroid, montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, and cromolyn is a mast cell stabilizer; none of these directly block vagal stimulation.\"}",
