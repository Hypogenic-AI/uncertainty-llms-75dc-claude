None of the options represent real medical scenarios or evidence-based treatments. The question explicitly acknowledges its own absurdity with phrases like 'incomprehensible,' 'ludicrous,' 'preposterous,' and 'nonsensical.' Option 4 directly addresses this absurdity and is the only intellectually honest response to a question that has no legitimate medical answer. As a medical expert, I cannot provide guidance on fictional scenarios that have no basis in reality or clinical practice.\"\n}\n```",
