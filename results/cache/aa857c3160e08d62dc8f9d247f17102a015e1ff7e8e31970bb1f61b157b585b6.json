While polyps and colitis can also cause bleeding, colon cancer is a more likely cause in this age group. Diverticulitis usually presents with pain and sometimes bleeding, but it is more common in the distal colon. The student's answer was incorrect because diverticulitis is not the most common cause of proximal colon bleeding in a 70-year-old female.\"}",
