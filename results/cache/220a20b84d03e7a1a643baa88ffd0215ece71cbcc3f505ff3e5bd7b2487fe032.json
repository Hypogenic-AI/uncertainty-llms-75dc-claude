In human biochemistry, Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is a key regulator of these pathways. The other options, while described in mystical terms, do not serve this specific regulatory role. The evidence quality is normal for the underlying science, though the scenario is fictional.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
