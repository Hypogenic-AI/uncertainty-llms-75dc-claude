  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Both 1 and 2\", \"confidence\": 7, \"reasoning\": \"The question asks about 'the classification' in what appears to be a dental/orthodontic context. Since the student incorrectly answered 'Dewey,' and given that dental malocclusion classifications are commonly associated with both Ackerman and Proffit (who have developed classification systems in orthodontics), while Dewey is known for library classification rather than dental classification, the correct answer is likely 'Both 1 and 2' (Ackerman and Proffit). This makes sense as both have contributed to orthodontic classification systems.\"}",
