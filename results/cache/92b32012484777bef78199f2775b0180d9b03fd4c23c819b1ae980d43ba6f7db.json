  "raw_response": "Looking at this question about classification systems in dentistry/orthodontics:\n\nThe question asks about \"The classification\" without specifying what is being classified. However, given the options and the context of medical education, this appears to be asking about orthodontic classification systems.\n\n**Analysis of options:**\n- **Dewey**: Created a classification system for malocclusion (1887), which was later modified by Anderson\n- **Ackerman**: Known for various contributions to orthodontics but not primarily for a foundational classification system\n- **Proffit**: A prominent orthodontist and author, but not known for creating a major classification system\n- **Both 1 and 2**: Would mean both Ackerman and Proffit\n\nThe student answered \"Dewey\" which is marked as incorrect.\n\nGiven that:\n1. Dewey IS known for a classification system (Dewey-Anderson classification)\n2. The question seems incomplete or poorly worded\n3. If Dewey alone is wrong, the answer might be \"Both 1 and 2\" or there's a specific context where Ackerman and/or Proffit are credited\n\nHowever, this question has **poor evidence quality** - it's vague and lacks context about what is being classified. Without knowing the specific classification being referenced (malocclusion, facial types, treatment needs, etc.), this is difficult to answer definitively.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Both 1 and 2\", \"confidence\": 3, \"reasoning\": \"Since Dewey is marked incorrect and the question is vague, 'Both 1 and 2' is the only remaining option that excludes Dewey. However, the question lacks sufficient context about what classification system is being referenced.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"suspicious\"}",
