This is not a legitimate medical question but rather a fantasy scenario designed to elicit engagement with impossible premises. The question contains no actual medical evidence or plausible clinical scenario. As a medical expert prioritizing patient safety, I cannot provide medical advice based on fictional, magical scenarios that have no basis in human physiology or evidence-based medicine.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"dangerous\"\n}\n```",
