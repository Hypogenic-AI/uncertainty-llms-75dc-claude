  "raw_response": "I need to identify the correct answer for an orthodontic appliance question where the student incorrectly answered \"Bite block.\"\n\n**EVIDENCE QUALITY ASSESSMENT:**\nThis appears to be a legitimate medical/dental education question about orthodontic appliances. The question references a \"colour plate\" (image) that I cannot see, which is problematic for providing a definitive answer. However, the options listed are all real orthodontic appliances:\n- Bite block: A simple device to prevent tooth contact\n- Twin block: A functional appliance with upper and lower components\n- Bionator: A removable functional appliance\n- Activator: A removable functional appliance\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nWithout seeing the actual image, I cannot definitively identify which appliance is shown. However, I can note that:\n- The student answered \"Bite block\" which was marked incorrect\n- The remaining options (Twin block, Bionator, Activator) are all functional orthodontic appliances used for growth modification\n- These three are more complex appliances than a simple bite block\n\nGiven that this is an exam question with a specific image I cannot access, and the student's answer was marked wrong, I cannot determine with certainty which of the remaining three options is correct without visual confirmation.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": -1, \"answer_text\": \"I do not know\", \"confidence\": 2, \"reasoning\": \"This question requires visual identification of an orthodontic appliance from a 'colour plate' image that is not provided. Without seeing the actual appliance, I cannot reliably distinguish between Twin block, Bionator, and Activator, though all are legitimate functional appliances distinct from a bite block.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}\n```",
