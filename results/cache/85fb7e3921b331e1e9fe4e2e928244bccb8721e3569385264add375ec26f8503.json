  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- 62-year-old woman with small-cell lung cancer\n- Painful, burning red rash on sun-exposed areas (face, hands)\n- Developed 30 minutes after 10 minutes of sun exposure\n- Taking demeclocycline and amoxicillin\n- Erythema and papular eruption on sun-exposed areas only\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis is a classic presentation of **phototoxic drug reaction** (photosensitivity).\n\n**Demeclocycline** is a tetracycline antibiotic well-known for causing phototoxic reactions. The mechanism involves:\n- Drug or its metabolites absorbing UV radiation\n- Formation of reactive oxygen species and free radicals\n- Direct cellular damage in sun-exposed skin\n- This is a **non-immunologic** reaction\n\nThe clinical features that support phototoxicity:\n- Rapid onset (30 minutes after brief exposure)\n- Limited to sun-exposed areas\n- Exaggerated sunburn-like reaction\n- Known photosensitizing medication\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n\n0. **Degranulation of presensitized mast cells** - This describes type I hypersensitivity (allergic reaction), not phototoxicity\n\n1. **Formation of drug-induced autoantibodies** - This describes drug-induced lupus or other autoimmune phenomena, not acute phototoxicity\n\n2. **Accumulation of porphobilinogen** - This relates to porphyrias, which can cause photosensitivity but wouldn't be drug-induced and wouldn't present this acutely\n\n3. **Cell injury due to drug metabolites** - This correctly describes phototoxic reactions where drug metabolites absorb UV light and cause direct cellular damage through free radical formation\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a medically sound, clinically realistic scenario with appropriate medical details.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Cell injury due to drug metabolites\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Classic phototoxic reaction from demeclocycline. Drug metabolites absorb UV radiation causing direct cellular damage via free radicals in sun-exposed",
