  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- Exertional dyspnea, orthopnea (extra pillows), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND)\n- Chronic alcohol use (5-8 drinks/day for 20 years)\n- Hypertension (135/115 mm Hg)\n- Tachypnea (24/min)\n- Bilateral pitting edema\n- Bibasilar crackles\n\n**Diagnosis:** This is classic **congestive heart failure (CHF)**, likely from alcoholic cardiomyopathy given the extensive alcohol history.\n\n**Pathophysiology of CHF and Renal Response:**\n\nIn heart failure, decreased cardiac output leads to:\n1. Reduced renal perfusion\n2. Activation of RAAS (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system)\n3. Increased sympathetic tone\n4. Release of ADH\n\n**Analyzing Each Option:**\n\n**Option 0: Decreased GFR** - In CHF, reduced cardiac output \u2192 reduced renal perfusion \u2192 decreased GFR. This is correct.\n\n**Option 1: Decreased ECF volume** - INCORRECT. The patient has volume overload (edema, crackles), indicating increased ECF volume.\n\n**Option 2: Increased renal blood flow** - INCORRECT. Renal blood flow is decreased due to reduced cardiac output.\n\n**Option 3: Increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption** - This occurs via RAAS activation and contributes to fluid retention, but the question asks what is \"associated with\" the condition. Decreased GFR is the primary renal manifestation.\n\nThe most direct answer is **decreased GFR**, which is a cardinal feature of cardiorenal syndrome in heart failure.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR)\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This patient has heart failure from likely alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Reduced cardiac output leads to decreased renal perfusion and decreased GFR, which is a fundamental feature of cardiorenal syndrome in CH",
