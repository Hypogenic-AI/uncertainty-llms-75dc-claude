  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this medical question systematically.\n\n**Clinical Presentation Analysis:**\n- 31-year-old woman\n- Dragging pelvic pain\n- Weight loss (3 kg over 6 months)\n- Irregular menses (30-45 day intervals)\n- **Fever (38\u00b0C)**\n- **Tachycardia (102/min)**\n- **Hyperreflexia**\n- Negative pregnancy test\n- 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass on ultrasound\n\n**Key Clinical Clues:**\nThe combination of:\n1. Adnexal mass\n2. Fever + tachycardia + hyperreflexia (signs of hyperthyroidism)\n3. Weight loss\n4. Menstrual irregularities\n\nThis constellation strongly suggests **struma ovarii** - a specialized teratoma containing thyroid tissue that can cause hyperthyroidism.\n\n**Why Each Answer:**\n\n- **Germ cells (Option 0)**: Teratomas (including struma ovarii) are derived from germ cells. This explains the thyroid tissue in the ovary and the hyperthyroid symptoms.\n\n- **Chorionic epithelial cells (Option 1)**: Would indicate choriocarcinoma or gestational trophoblastic disease, but pregnancy test is NEGATIVE. This is the student's incorrect answer.\n\n- **Endometrial cells (Option 2)**: Would suggest endometrioma, which doesn't cause systemic hyperthyroid symptoms.\n\n- **Stromal cells (Option 3)**: Would suggest sex cord-stromal tumors, which don't typically present with hyperthyroidism.\n\n**Evidence Quality:** Normal - this is a classic presentation of struma ovarii.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Germ cells\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"The fever, tachycardia, hyperreflexia, and weight loss indicate hyperthyroidism from struma ovarii (thyroid tissue in ovary). Teratomas arise from germ cells. Negative pregnancy test rules out chorionic epithelial origin.\", \"evidence_quality\":",
