In real medical practice, necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) can present with gasless abdomen in severe cases due to bowel wall necrosis and loss of normal bowel gas patterns. While acute pancreatitis can show ileus, and intussusception may show absence of gas in affected segments, NEC is classically associated with severe bowel wall compromise that could theoretically result in a gasless abdomen in advanced stages. The absurd framing makes this challenging, but translating to actual pathophysiology, NEC best fits the scenario described.\"}",
