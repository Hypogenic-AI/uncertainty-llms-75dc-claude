Pregnancy can cause fibroadenomas to enlarge, but the key features (young woman, mobile, rubbery, well-circumscribed mass) and histology fit fibroadenoma best. Phyllodes tumor is rarer and typically has a leaf-like architecture on histology. Fat necrosis is associated with trauma and would show necrotic fat and calcifications. Normal pregnancy changes would not present as a discrete mass with these features.\"}",
