Her ABG shows respiratory acidosis (low pH, high PCO2, normal HCO3-), which is consistent with hypoventilation. Opioid overdose is a classic cause of this triad: CNS depression, respiratory depression, and miosis (constricted pupils). The other options do not fit the clinical or laboratory findings.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
