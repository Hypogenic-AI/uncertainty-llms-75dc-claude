According to established asthma guidelines, the next step is to add a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid such as fluticasone. Salmeterol (a long-acting beta-agonist) is not used as monotherapy and is reserved for more severe cases in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid. Zileuton is rarely used in children and is not first-line. Maintaining current therapy is inappropriate as symptoms are not controlled.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
