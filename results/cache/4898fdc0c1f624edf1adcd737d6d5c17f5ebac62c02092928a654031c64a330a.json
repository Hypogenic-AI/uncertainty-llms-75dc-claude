  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"The symptoms suggest that it could be a digitalis toxicity.\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This 90-year-old patient presents with classic signs of digoxin toxicity: GI symptoms (nausea, anorexia, abdominal discomfort), fatigue, bradycardia (HR 48), and cardiac arrhythmia (bigeminy). The digoxin dosing is concerning - 5 tablets of 0.25mg per week equals 1.25mg/week or approximately 0.18mg/day, which is reasonable, BUT the patient is also on furosemide (can cause hypokalemia despite K+ supplements), has renal impairment risk at age 90, and is on bisoprolol (beta-blocker) which compounds bradycardia. The combination of bradycardia with bigeminy (a classic digoxin toxicity rhythm) plus GI symptoms is pathognomonic for digitalis toxicity. This is NOT anxiety (option 3 - the student's incorrect answer), NOT simple CHF worsening (would expect tachycardia, not bradycardia), and NOT just dyspepsia. This requires urgent digoxin level check and potential treatment, not anxiolytics.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
