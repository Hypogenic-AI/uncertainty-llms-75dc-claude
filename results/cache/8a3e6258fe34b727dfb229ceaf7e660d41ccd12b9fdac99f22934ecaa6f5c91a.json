One of its well-known side effects is peripheral edema, particularly in the lower extremities, due to preferential arteriolar dilation leading to increased capillary hydrostatic pressure. The patient's recent onset of bilateral leg swelling after starting antihypertensive therapy, with normal labs and no other findings, is most consistent with amlodipine-induced edema.\"}",
