  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"XII\", \"confidence\": 8, \"reasoning\": \"The patient with sickle cell anemia and splenomegaly is likely receiving heparin for DVT prophylaxis. Heparin increases the activity of antithrombin III, which inhibits several clotting factors, most notably factors IIa (thrombin) and Xa, but also affects the intrinsic pathway, which is measured by PTT. Among the options, factor XII is part of the intrinsic pathway and its activity would be reflected in a prolonged PTT. However, heparin does not directly inhibit factor XII, but rather factors IIa and Xa. Given the options, factor XII is most associated with the intrinsic pathway and elevated PTT, making it the best answer among those listed.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
