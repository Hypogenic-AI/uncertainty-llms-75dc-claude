  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation, I need to analyze the key features:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- 30-year-old woman, asymptomatic\n- Routine gynecologic check-up\n- Normal Pap smear history\n- Small, firm, non-tender, immobile cystic mass\n- Located at edge of exocervical os\n- Yellow hue\n- No other complaints\n\n**Clinical Reasoning:**\n\nThe description of a \"small, firm, non-tender, immobile cystic mass at the edge of the exocervical os with a yellow hue\" is highly characteristic of a **nabothian cyst** (also called nabothian follicle).\n\nNabothian cysts are:\n- Benign retention cysts of the cervix\n- Form when mucus-secreting glands become obstructed\n- Appear as smooth, round, yellow-white cystic lesions\n- Very common finding on routine pelvic examination\n- Completely benign with no malignant potential\n- Usually asymptomatic\n\n**Management Considerations:**\n\n1. **No further intervention** - Appropriate for benign nabothian cysts\n2. **Colposcopy and biopsy** - Would be indicated if there were concerning features suggesting malignancy or dysplasia\n3. **Oral contraceptives** - Not indicated for nabothian cysts\n4. **Antibiotics** - Would be for infection; this is non-tender and not infectious\n\nGiven the benign nature of nabothian cysts and the absence of any concerning features (normal Pap smears, no symptoms, classic appearance), no intervention is needed.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a straightforward clinical scenario with a classic presentation of a common benign finding. The question is medically sound and evidence-based.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"No further intervention\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"The clinical description is classic for a nabothian cyst - a benign cervical retention cyst.
