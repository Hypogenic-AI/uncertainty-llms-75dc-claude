The drug described as directly antagonizing the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways is an anticholinergic (muscarinic antagonist). Tiotropium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) used in COPD to cause bronchodilation by blocking acetylcholine-mediated bronchoconstriction. The other options do not directly antagonize vagal stimulation: fluticasone is a corticosteroid, montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, and cromolyn is a mast cell stabilizer.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
