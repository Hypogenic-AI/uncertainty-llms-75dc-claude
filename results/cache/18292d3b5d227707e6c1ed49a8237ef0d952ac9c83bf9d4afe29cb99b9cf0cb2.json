When present, they are highly specific for Crohn's disease (though not sensitive due to patchy distribution)\n\n3. **Pseudopolyps**: Inflammatory polyps seen in chronic IBD, more common in ulcerative colitis - NOT specific for Crohn's\n\n**Most Specific Finding:** Noncaseating granulomas are the most specific histologic finding for Crohn's disease, even though they're not always present.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Formation of noncaseating granulomas\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Classic Crohn's disease presentation with terminal ileum and transverse colon involvement (skip lesions).
