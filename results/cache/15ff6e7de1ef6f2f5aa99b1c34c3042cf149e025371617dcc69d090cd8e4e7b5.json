  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells\", \"confidence\": 8, \"reasoning\": \"After alveolar damage in ARDS, the regeneration process involves Type II pneumocytes (alveolar cells). Type II pneumocytes serve two critical functions: they secrete surfactant and act as progenitor cells for alveolar repair. When Type I pneumocytes (which cover most of the alveolar surface area) are damaged, Type II pneumocytes proliferate to replace them and restore the alveolar lining. Type II pneumocytes are the surfactant-secreting cells. Ciliated cells and goblet cells are found in conducting airways, not alveoli. Club cells (formerly Clara cells) are found in terminal bronchioles, not alveoli. Therefore, proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells (Type II pneumocytes) is the correct answer for alveolar regeneration.\"}",
