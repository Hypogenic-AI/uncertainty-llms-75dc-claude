The student's answer was deviation to the right, which is incorrect. Among the remaining options, trismus (difficulty opening the mouth) and crepitus (grating sound) are common findings in condylar fractures due to muscle spasm and joint involvement. Moderate intraoral bleeding and inability to deviate to the right are less characteristic. Therefore, option 1 is most correct.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
