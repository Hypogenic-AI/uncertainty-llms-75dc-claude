  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Timing of the dosing of colesevelam should be separated from this patient's other medications.\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Colesevelam is a bile acid sequestrant used for cholesterol management. Its primary concern is that it can bind to other medications in the GI tract and reduce their absorption. This is particularly important for this patient taking levothyroxine (for hyperthyroidism - though the history states hyperthyroidism, levothyroxine suggests hypothyroidism treatment), oral contraceptives, and other medications. Bile acid sequestrants should be taken at least 4 hours before or after other medications. Option 1 (cholelithiasis) is more associated with fibrates. Option 0 (cognitive impairment) is not a recognized side effect. Option 3 is incorrect - bile acid sequestrants can actually increase HDL modestly, not decrease it significantly.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
