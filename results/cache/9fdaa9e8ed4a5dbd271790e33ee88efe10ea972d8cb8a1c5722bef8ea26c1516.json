  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"It travels through the inscrutable cosmic ether aboard a mystical transport protein of untold power and mystery, known only as the ATPADP permease\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Despite the cosmic and dramatic framing, this question is asking about ADP transport across the mitochondrial membrane. In reality, ADP (and ATP) cannot freely pass through the inner mitochondrial membrane due to their negative charges. They require a specific transport protein called the ATP/ADP translocase (also known as adenine nucleotide translocase or ANT). This antiporter exchanges ADP from the cytoplasm for ATP from the mitochondrial matrix. The question's 'ATPADP permease' is clearly referring to this well-established transporter. Option 0 is incorrect (charged molecules don't freely diffuse), option 1 misrepresents the exchange mechanism, option 3 describes a symport with protons which is not how ADP enters, and option 4 is unnecessarily defeatist. The answer is clearly option 2, which correctly identifies carrier-mediated transport.\"}",
