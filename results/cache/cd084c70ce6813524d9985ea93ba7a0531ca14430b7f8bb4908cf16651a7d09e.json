  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this dental restoration question systematically.\n\n**Question Analysis:**\n- Patient: Decayed mandibular 1st molar\n- Extent: Involves mesiobuccal AND distobuccal cusps (both buccal cusps)\n- Need: Definitive restoration choice\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:**\nThis is a straightforward, clinically sound dental question about restoration selection based on extent of decay. The scenario is plausible and follows standard dental practice considerations.\n\n**Clinical Reasoning:**\n\nWhen both buccal cusps of a mandibular molar are involved:\n1. **Extensive decay** - compromises structural integrity\n2. **Cusp coverage needed** - both cusps weakened and at risk of fracture\n3. **High occlusal forces** - mandibular 1st molar is a major load-bearing tooth\n\n**Restoration Options Analysis:**\n- **Intermediate restoration (0)**: Temporary, not definitive - INCORRECT\n- **Composite (1)**: Direct restoration; inadequate for extensive cusp involvement, poor wear resistance under heavy occlusal forces\n- **Cast metal (2)**: Provides cusp coverage (onlay/crown), excellent strength, ideal for posterior teeth with extensive cusp involvement - CORRECT\n- **GIC (3)**: Weak material, unsuitable for load-bearing areas with cusp involvement\n\n**Standard of Care:**\nWhen multiple cusps are involved in posterior teeth, indirect restorations (cast metal onlay or crown) are indicated to:\n- Provide cusp protection\n- Distribute occlusal forces\n- Prevent fracture\n- Ensure longevity\n\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Cast metal\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"With both buccal cusps involved in a mandibular 1st molar, cast metal restoration (onlay/crown) is indicated to provide cusp coverage, withstand heavy occlusal forces, and prevent fracture. Composite and GIC lack strength; intermediate is temporary.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
