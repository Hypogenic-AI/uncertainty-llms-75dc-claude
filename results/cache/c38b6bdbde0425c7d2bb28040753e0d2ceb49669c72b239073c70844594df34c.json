  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Thrombin formation\", \"confidence\": 8, \"reasoning\": \"Vitamin K antagonists (like warfarin) work by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X in the liver. This ultimately antagonizes thrombin formation, as these factors are necessary for the coagulation cascade that produces thrombin. The student's answer 'Production of clotting factors by liver' describes what vitamin K itself does (supports production), not what vitamin K antagonists antagonize. The question asks what vitamin K antagonizes, which is confusingly worded but likely means what vitamin K antagonists block - which is the pathway leading to thrombin formation.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
