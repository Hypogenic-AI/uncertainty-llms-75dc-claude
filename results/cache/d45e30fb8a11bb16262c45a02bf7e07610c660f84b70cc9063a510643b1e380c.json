  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"2-4 years old can use skim milk\", \"confidence\": 3, \"reasoning\": \"The question asks about training good eating habits in infants and children. Let me evaluate each option:\\n\\n0. Toilet training (gold/potty training) typically occurs between 2-3 years, which is accurate\\n1. Teaching simple table manners after age 3 is appropriate and reasonable\\n2. Using skim milk for 2-4 year olds is NOT recommended - children this age need whole milk or at least 2% milk for proper brain development and fat-soluble vitamin absorption. Skim milk is generally not recommended until after age 5\\n3. Limiting sugary drinks and using diluted fruit juice is appropriate advice\\n\\nSince the student's answer (option 2) was marked as INCORRECT, and option 2 is indeed inappropriate nutritional advice for young children, the correct answer must be one of the other options. Options 0, 1, and 3 all represent appropriate guidance. However, I need to identify which one is 'most appropriate' for training good eating habits specifically. Option 3 directly addresses dietary habits, making it likely the most appropriate answer for the question about eating habits.\"}",
