CSF analysis shows albuminocytologic dissociation (high protein, normal cell count), classic for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). The most appropriate next step in treatment for GBS is IVIG or plasmapheresis. Steroids (prednisone) are not effective in GBS, botulism antitoxin is for botulism, and gabapentin is for neuropathic pain, not acute management of GBS.\"}",
