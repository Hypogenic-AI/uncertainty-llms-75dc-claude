Glutamine donates the amino group at the N9 position in the purine ring, which is a well-established fact in biochemistry. THFA (tetrahydrofolic acid) is involved in the formation of C2 and C8, not C6. IMP, not GMP, is the first nucleotide formed in purine synthesis.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
