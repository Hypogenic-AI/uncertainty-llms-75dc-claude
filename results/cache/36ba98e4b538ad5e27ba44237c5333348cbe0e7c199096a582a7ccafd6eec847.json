  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this medical question systematically.\n\n**Assessment of Evidence Quality**: This is a legitimate surgical complication question about the Burch colposuspension procedure. The scenario describes bleeding in the space of Retzius (retropubic space) where the source cannot be visualized - a recognized complication. This is **normal** medical content.\n\n**Clinical Analysis**:\n- The Burch operation is a retropubic urethropexy for stress urinary incontinence\n- The space of Retzius contains venous plexuses that can bleed significantly\n- When bleeding occurs but the source cannot be visualized, blind suturing (option 1) is dangerous and can:\n  - Damage nearby structures (bladder, ureters, vessels)\n  - Worsen bleeding\n  - Not address the actual source\n\n**Correct Management**:\nWhen there's non-visualizable bleeding in the space of Retzius during Burch procedure, the standard technique is to **lift the endopelvic fascia by placing fingers in the vagina** (option 2). This:\n- Elevates the surgical field\n- Compresses venous plexuses against the pubic bone\n- Improves visualization of bleeding source\n- Allows controlled hemostasis\n\nThis is a well-established surgical maneuver for this specific complication.\n\n**Answer**:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer_index\": 2,\n  \"answer_text\": \"Lift endopelvic fascia by putting fingers in vagina\",\n  \"confidence\": 9,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Lifting the endopelvic fascia vaginally is the standard technique to control non-visualizable bleeding in the space of Retzius during Burch procedure. It provides compression and improves visualization. Blind suturing is contraindicated as it risks damaging vital structures.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"\n}\n```",
