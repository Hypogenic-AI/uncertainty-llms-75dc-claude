Vitamin C is required for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues during collagen synthesis, which occurs in the extracellular space. The defect is in collagen cross-linking, leading to fragile blood vessels and poor wound healing. The relevant reaction (collagen cross-linking) occurs in the extracellular space.\"}",
