  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"The interaction of broadleaf vegetables is crucial, for this treatment works by inhibiting the action of vitamin K, leading to a cascade of bizarre and bewildering events, including the spontaneous growth of additional ears and eyes\", \"confidence\": 8, \"reasoning\": \"Despite the fantastical framing, this question is asking about a real medical interaction. Acenocoumarol is a vitamin K antagonist (anticoagulant) similar to warfarin. Broadleaf vegetables (like spinach, kale, lettuce) are high in vitamin K. The key medical fact is that acenocoumarol works by INHIBITING vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. When patients on acenocoumarol consume large amounts of vitamin K-rich vegetables, it can counteract the anticoagulant effect. Option 2 correctly identifies that the treatment works by inhibiting vitamin K action, making the interaction with broadleaf vegetables clinically significant. The bizarre additions about ears and eyes are just creative embellishment, but the core pharmacological principle is accurate.\"}",
