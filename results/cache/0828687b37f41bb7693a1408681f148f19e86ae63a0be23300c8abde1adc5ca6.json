  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Drug is not extensively distribution to tissue\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Volume of distribution (Vd) is a pharmacokinetic parameter that relates the amount of drug in the body to the plasma concentration. A LOW Vd indicates the drug remains primarily in the plasma/blood compartment and does not extensively distribute into tissues. This is typically seen with large, polar, or highly protein-bound drugs. Vd is independent of half-life, bioavailability, and efficacy. The student's answer about half-life is incorrect as Vd and half-life are separate parameters, though both influence dosing regimens.\"}",
