  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Clinical Presentation:**\n- 63-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease (CKD)\n- Severe back pain with L2 wedge compression fracture\n- Low calcium (8.2 mg/dL - normal 8.5-10.5)\n- Elevated creatinine (3.8 mg/dL) indicating advanced CKD\n\n**Key Analysis:**\n\n**Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (Option 1):**\n- Most common in CKD patients\n- Mechanism: Low calcium \u2192 PTH elevation \u2192 bone resorption\n- This patient has hypocalcemia (8.2 mg/dL) consistent with CKD\n- CKD causes phosphate retention and decreased vitamin D activation\n- Results in renal osteodystrophy with pathologic fractures\n- **This fits perfectly**\n\n**Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism (Option 0):**\n- Develops after prolonged secondary hyperparathyroidism\n- Characterized by autonomous PTH secretion and **hypercalcemia**\n- This patient has **hypocalcemia**, not hypercalcemia\n- **Does not fit**\n\n**Primary Hyperparathyroidism (Option 3):**\n- Parathyroid adenoma/hyperplasia\n- Presents with **hypercalcemia**\n- Patient has hypocalcemia\n- **Does not fit**\n\n**Elder Abuse (Option 2):**\n- While social stressors mentioned, the fracture pattern and metabolic findings point to pathologic bone disease\n- Wedge compression fractures are classic for metabolic bone disease\n- No other signs of trauma mentioned\n\nThe hypocalcemia in a CKD patient with a pathologic fracture is pathognomonic for secondary hyperparathyroidism.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Secondary hyperparathyroidism\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Patient has CKD (creatinine 3.8) with hypocalcemia (8.2 mg/dL) and pathologic fracture.
