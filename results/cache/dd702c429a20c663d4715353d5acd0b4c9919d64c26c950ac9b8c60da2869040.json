  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this question about micelle formation and surfactant behavior.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment**: This is a standard physical chemistry/pharmaceutical sciences question about surfactant behavior and micelle formation. The concepts (CMC, Kraft point, light scattering, liquid crystals) are all legitimate scientific terms. This appears to be a normal educational question.\n\n**Analysis of Each Option**:\n\n**Option 0 (Kraft point)**: The Kraft point (or Krafft temperature) is indeed the temperature above which an ionic surfactant's solubility increases dramatically and micelle formation becomes favorable. Below this temperature, the surfactant exists primarily as crystalline hydrated solid or monomers; above it, micelles form readily. This statement is **CORRECT**.\n\n**Option 1 (Below CMC)**: This is **INCORRECT**. Below the CMC, surfactants exist primarily as monomers (individual molecules) in solution, NOT as liquid crystals. Liquid crystals typically form at much higher concentrations, well above the CMC.\n\n**Option 2 (Light scattering decreases)**: This is **INCORRECT** (the student's wrong answer). Light scattering actually **INCREASES** sharply at the CMC because micelles are larger particles than monomers, causing more light scattering.\n\n**Option 3 (CMC varies greatly with temperature)**: This is **INCORRECT**. The CMC typically shows relatively modest variation with temperature for most surfactants. While temperature does affect CMC, it doesn't vary \"greatly\" - the effect is usually moderate.\n\nThe correct answer is **Option 0**.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"The Kraft point marks the transition between the solubility of an ionic surfactant in the form of ions or in the form of micelles.\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"The Kraft point correctly describes the temperature-dependent transition in surfactant solubility behavior. The student's answer is wrong because light scattering increases (not decreases) at CMC due to micelle formation creating larger scattering particles.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}\n```",
