With the use of a dental operating microscope (DOM), which provides magnification and illumination, the detection rate of MB2 canals is significantly enhanced. Multiple studies have shown that when using a DOM, MB2 canals can be identified in approximately 90-95% of maxillary first molars. Without magnification, the detection rate is much lower (around 30-40%), which is what the student incorrectly selected. The DOM has revolutionized endodontic practice by dramatically improving the ability to locate these commonly missed canals.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
