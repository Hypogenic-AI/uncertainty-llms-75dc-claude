  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Clinical Picture Analysis:**\n- IV drug user with fever, chills, severe back pain\n- High-pitched systolic murmur at left sternal border that increases with inspiration (classic for tricuspid regurgitation)\n- Blood culture positive for S. aureus at 12 hours\n- Strong clinical suspicion for infective endocarditis (IE)\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:**\nThis is a medically sound, realistic clinical scenario. The presentation is classic for right-sided endocarditis in an IVDU, with appropriate vital signs, physical findings, and microbiological results.\n\n**Diagnostic Approach:**\nAccording to modified Duke criteria for IE diagnosis, one of the major criteria is:\n- Microbiological evidence: typical microorganisms from **2 separate blood cultures** OR persistently positive blood cultures\n\n**Current Guidelines for Blood Cultures in Suspected IE:**\n- Initial: Draw 3 sets of blood cultures from different sites before antibiotics\n- If initial cultures are positive (as in this case), repeat blood cultures are needed to:\n  1. Confirm persistent bacteremia (supports IE diagnosis)\n  2. Document clearance after treatment initiation\n  \n**Timing of Repeat Cultures:**\n- Standard practice: Repeat blood cultures should be drawn **within 24-48 hours** after starting antibiotics\n- Since initial cultures were drawn 12 hours ago and one is already positive, repeating cultures NOW (at approximately 12 hours after initial draw, shortly after starting antibiotics) is most appropriate to establish the diagnosis and baseline before antibiotics have had significant effect\n\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Repeat blood cultures now\", \"confidence\": 8, \"reasoning\": \"With suspected IE and one positive blood culture, repeat cultures should be drawn promptly to confirm persistent bacteremia per Duke criteria. Drawing them now (12 hours after initial, shortly after antibiotic initiation) establishes baseline and helps confirm diagnosis before antibiotics clear bacteremia.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
