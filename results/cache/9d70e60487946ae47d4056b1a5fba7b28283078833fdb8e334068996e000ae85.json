  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this clinical case systematically.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a well-constructed clinical vignette with plausible medical details - recent head trauma, specific neurological findings, and appropriate differential diagnoses. The presentation is medically sound.\n\n**Clinical Analysis:**\n\nKey findings:\n- 25-year-old woman with painful double vision (diplopia)\n- Bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO): adduction deficit with contralateral abducting nystagmus\n- Recent head trauma (10 days ago)\n- Bilateral disc hyperemia (optic disc swelling/inflammation)\n- Age: young adult\n\n**Bilateral INO indicates:** Lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) bilaterally\n\n**Critical distinguishing features:**\n\n1. **Demyelination of MLF (Option 0):**\n   - Most common cause of bilateral INO in young adults\n   - Multiple sclerosis is the classic etiology in this age group\n   - Painful eye movements suggest optic neuritis (common in MS)\n   - Disc hyperemia supports optic nerve inflammation\n   - Can follow trauma as a trigger\n   - **BEST FIT**\n\n2. **Compressive tumor (Option 1):**\n   - Would be gradual onset, not acute\n   - Less likely to cause bilateral symmetric findings\n   - Unlikely in 25-year-old\n\n3. **Thiamine deficiency/Wernicke's (Option 2):**\n   - Requires chronic alcoholism or malnutrition\n   - No supporting history\n   - Not indicated\n\n4. **Brainstem infarction (Option 3):**\n   - Rare in 25-year-old without risk factors\n   - Would expect other brainstem signs\n   - Less likely\n\nThe combination of bilateral INO + optic neuritis (disc hyperemia + pain) in a young woman strongly suggests **demyelinating disease (MS)**.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Bilateral INO with painful diplopia and disc hyperemia in a 25-",
