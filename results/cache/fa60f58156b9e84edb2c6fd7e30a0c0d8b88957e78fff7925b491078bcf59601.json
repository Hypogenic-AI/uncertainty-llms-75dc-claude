  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation systematically:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- 2-year-old boy (age is important)\n- Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS): saccadic eye movements in all directions + myoclonus (involuntary muscle contractions)\n- Ataxia (unsteady gait, frequent falls)\n- Abdominal mass in upper right abdomen\n\n**Clinical Reasoning:**\n\nThis is a classic presentation of **opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome (OMAS)**, also known as \"dancing eyes-dancing feet syndrome.\" This is a paraneoplastic syndrome most commonly associated with **neuroblastoma** in children.\n\nNeuroblastoma:\n- Most common extracranial solid tumor in children\n- Peak incidence at age 2\n- Arises from neural crest cells\n- Commonly located in adrenal medulla or sympathetic chain (explaining upper abdominal location)\n- Associated with OMS in ~2-3% of cases\n\n**Histopathologic Analysis of Options:**\n\n0. Starry sky pattern \u2192 Burkitt lymphoma (not consistent with presentation)\n1. Abortive glomeruli/tubules in spindle stroma \u2192 Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma)\n2. **Small blue cells in rosettes around neuropil \u2192 NEUROBLASTOMA** (Homer-Wright rosettes)\n3. Hepatocytes in fetal/embryonic stages \u2192 Hepatoblastoma\n\nWhile Wilms tumor is also common in this age group, it doesn't cause OMS and typically presents as a flank mass with different symptoms.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a standard, well-established clinical presentation with clear diagnostic criteria. The question is medically sound and evidence-based.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Classic presentation of opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome with abdominal mass in a 2-year-old strongly indicates neuroblastoma.
