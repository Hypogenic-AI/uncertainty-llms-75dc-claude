  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Babesiosis\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"The patient's presentation of fever, chills, night sweats, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes, along with the peripheral smear findings of intraerythrocytic basophilic ring- and pear-shaped structures, extracellular basophilic rings, and tetrad (Maltese cross) formations, is most consistent with babesiosis. Babesia species are known to form tetrads inside red blood cells, which is a classic diagnostic clue. Malaria can also cause intraerythrocytic rings, but the tetrad formation is characteristic of babesiosis. The travel history to the Netherlands is less typical for babesiosis, but the laboratory and smear findings are diagnostic. Tuberculosis and Lyme disease do not present with these hematologic or smear findings.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
