  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Randomization or use of a randomization rule is an utterly irrelevant and nonsensical control technique of experimental designs, for it bears no relevance to the sample size, which is a meaningless concept in the chaotic and unbounded realm of this bizarre planet\", \"confidence\": 7, \"reasoning\": \"This question asks which statement is UNTRUE about randomization. Despite the absurdist framing, we need to identify the false claim. Option 1 states that randomization 'bears no relevance to the sample size.' In reality, while randomization and sample size are distinct concepts, they are related - randomization helps ensure groups are comparable, but adequate sample size is needed for randomization to effectively balance confounders. However, the statement that randomization 'bears no relevance' to sample size is the most clearly false claim among the options, as randomization's effectiveness does depend on having sufficient sample size. The other options, while phrased absurdly, contain kernels of truth about randomization being used in experimental designs (0), applying to various design types (2), and reducing selection bias (3).\"}",
