The first-line treatment is ethosuximide, whose most common side effect is GI upset (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain). The other options are associated with other antiepileptics: nystagmus (phenytoin), facial rash and blood in urine (lamotrigine or phenytoin, but not ethosuximide), and weight gain/change in hair color (not typical for ethosuximide).\"}",
