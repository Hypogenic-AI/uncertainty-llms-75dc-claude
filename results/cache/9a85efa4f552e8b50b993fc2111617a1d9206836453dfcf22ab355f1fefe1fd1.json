  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Opioid overdose\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"The patient presents with classic signs of opioid overdose: unconsciousness, respiratory depression (RR 7/min), pinpoint pupils, and flexor response to pain. The ABG shows respiratory acidosis (pH 7.26, PCO2 70 mmHg) with normal HCO3- (26 mEq/L), indicating acute hypoventilation without metabolic compensation. This is consistent with opioid-induced respiratory depression. Diabetic ketoacidosis would show metabolic acidosis with low HCO3-. Diuretic overdose typically causes metabolic alkalosis. Hyperventilation would cause respiratory alkalosis, not acidosis.\"}",
