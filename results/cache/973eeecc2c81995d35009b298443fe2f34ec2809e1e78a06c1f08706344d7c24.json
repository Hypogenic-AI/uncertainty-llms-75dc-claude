  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation systematically:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- 28-year-old woman with 4-month amenorrhea\n- Negative pregnancy tests, no sexual activity\n- Galactorrhea (milk production)\n- Bitemporal visual field defects (temporal field defects)\n- Recurrent headaches (started 5 months ago)\n- Progressive peripheral vision loss\n- Car accident 3 months ago (didn't see car coming - suggests vision problems preceded accident)\n\n**Clinical Reasoning:**\n\nThe triad of **galactorrhea + amenorrhea + bitemporal visual field defects** is pathognomonic for a **prolactinoma** (prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma).\n\n**Pathophysiology:**\n1. The tumor produces excess prolactin \u2192 galactorrhea\n2. High prolactin inhibits GnRH pulsatility from the hypothalamus\n3. Decreased GnRH \u2192 decreased FSH/LH \u2192 hypogonadism \u2192 amenorrhea\n4. Tumor mass effect on optic chiasm \u2192 bitemporal hemianopsia\n5. Mass effect \u2192 headaches\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n\n- **Option 0**: Inhibition of GnRH release - This is the correct mechanism. Hyperprolactinemia suppresses hypothalamic GnRH pulsatile secretion.\n\n- **Option 1**: Intrauterine scar tissue (Asherman syndrome) - Would not explain galactorrhea or visual defects\n\n- **Option 2**: Chromosomal nondisjunction - Would present from birth/puberty, not acute onset at age 28\n\n- **Option 3**: Nutritional imbalance - Could cause amenorrhea but wouldn't explain galactorrhea or visual field defects\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a classic, well-constructed clinical vignette with medically sound presentation of prolactinoma. Normal evidence quality.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone release\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Classic presentation of prolactinoma with galactorrhea, amenorrh",
