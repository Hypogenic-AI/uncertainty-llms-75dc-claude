The elevated WBC count (13,000) and markedly elevated CRP (16.4, normal <3.1) support an infectious/inflammatory process. The key findings are:\\n\\n1. CVA tenderness = kidney involvement\\n2. Fever + elevated inflammatory markers = infection\\n3. Normal creatinine = kidney function preserved\\n\\nFor suspected pyelonephritis, the most appropriate NEXT step is urinalysis with urine culture to:\\n- Confirm pyuria (WBCs in urine)\\n- Identify bacteria\\n- Guide antibiotic therapy\\n\\nWhy not the other options:\\n- CT abdomen (student's answer): Not indicated as first-line; reserved for complicated cases or when diagnosis is unclear\\n- Cervical swab: Would evaluate for STIs but doesn't explain CVA tenderness\\n- Blood culture: May be done in severe cases but urinalysis is the primary diagnostic test\\n\\nUrinalysis is the essential first diagnostic step for suspected UTI/pyelonephritis.\"}",
