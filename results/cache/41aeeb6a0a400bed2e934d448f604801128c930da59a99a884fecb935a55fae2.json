Vitamin C is required for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues during collagen synthesis, which occurs in the rough ER, but the final cross-linking of collagen fibers (which is defective in scurvy) occurs in the extracellular space. The bleeding and poor wound healing are due to defective collagen in the extracellular matrix.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
