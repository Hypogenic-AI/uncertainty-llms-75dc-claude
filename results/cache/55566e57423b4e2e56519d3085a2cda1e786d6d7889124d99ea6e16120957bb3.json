  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 4, \"answer_text\": \"Conceding defeat in the face of this utter absurdity and admitting ignorance to the baffling illogic of the situation, for it defies the very foundations of reason and sanity\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This question is deliberately absurd and nonsensical, mixing fantasy elements (unicorns, magical lands) with scientific terminology in a way that makes no coherent sense. The question references a pedigree that is not provided, making it impossible to analyze any actual inheritance pattern. The options themselves are written in flowery, fantastical language that obscures rather than clarifies any real genetic concepts. Option 4 explicitly acknowledges the absurdity of the question, which is the most honest and appropriate response to a question that appears designed to be unanswerable or to test whether one recognizes nonsense when presented with it. Without an actual pedigree to analyze and with deliberately confusing language, the only reasonable response is to acknowledge that the question itself is fundamentally flawed.\"}",
