  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Performing the preposterous Javal Schiotz method, where the thickness of the cornea is measured by dropping a lead weight from a tower, and observing the reaction of the cornea to the sudden impact, while the court jester narrates the proceedings in an exaggerated manner\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Despite the whimsical framing, this question asks about actual corneal thickness measurement methods. OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) is a real method using light waves. Ultrasound pachymetry (the 'utrasonographic technique') is a real method. Orbscan is a real corneal topography/pachymetry system. However, the Javal-Schiotz method is actually a keratometry technique used to measure corneal CURVATURE, not thickness. The description of dropping weights and observing impact is completely fabricated and not how any corneal measurement works. This would NOT be used to measure corneal thickness, making it the correct answer to what would NOT be used.\"}",
