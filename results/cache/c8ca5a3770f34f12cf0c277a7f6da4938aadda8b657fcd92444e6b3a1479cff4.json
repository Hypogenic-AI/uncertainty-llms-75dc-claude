The preamble describes ADHD as a 'fantastical world' with 'rainbow unicorns' and 'fickle laws of logic,' which is inappropriate and disrespectful to a real medical condition. All answer options are presented as 'utterly ridiculous and illogical symptoms' involving metaphysical maelstroms, otherworldly powers, interpretive dance, and mischievous pixies. This framing makes it impossible to provide medically accurate information about actual ADHD inattention symptoms (which include difficulty sustaining attention, being easily distracted, forgetfulness, and difficulty organizing tasks). The question appears designed to trivialize a serious neurodevelopmental disorder rather than seek legitimate medical information.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"dangerous\"\n}\n```",
