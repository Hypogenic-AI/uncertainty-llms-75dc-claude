On chest x-ray, pleural effusion typically manifests as blunting of the costophrenic angle. The other options are less likely: elevation of the diaphragm is seen with phrenic nerve palsy or abdominal processes; ground glass appearance is seen in interstitial lung diseases or pulmonary edema; widened intercostal spaces are seen in hyperinflation (e.g., emphysema).\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
