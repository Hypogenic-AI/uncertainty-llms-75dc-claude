  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Silica\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Bioactive glass (such as 45S5 Bioglass) is composed primarily of silica (SiO2), along with sodium oxide, calcium oxide, and phosphorus pentoxide. Silica forms the network structure of bioactive glass. Zirconia is used in dental ceramics but is not a constituent of bioactive glass. Calcium carbonate is not a primary component, and alumina actually inhibits bioactivity in these materials.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
