  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation systematically:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- 38-year-old woman\n- 1-month history, slowly enlarging\n- Painless, nonpruritic\n- 0.8-cm hyperpigmented papule on thigh\n- **Positive dimple sign** (surface retracts inward when squeezed)\n- Normal vital signs\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe **dimple sign (Fitzpatrick's sign)** is pathognomonic for dermatofibroma. This occurs because the fibrous tissue is tethered to the overlying epidermis, causing central depression when lateral pressure is applied.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n1. **Dermatofibroma**: \n   - Classic presentation in young to middle-aged adults\n   - Common on extremities (especially legs in women)\n   - Firm, hyperpigmented papule\n   - **Positive dimple sign is diagnostic**\n   - Often mistaken for insect bite initially\n   - Slowly enlarging over weeks to months\n   - \u2713 Perfect match\n\n2. **Cherry hemangioma**: Bright red, vascular papule; no dimple sign; doesn't match hyperpigmented description\n\n3. **Actinic keratosis**: Rough, scaly; sun-exposed areas; older patients; no dimple sign\n\n4. **Seborrheic keratosis**: \"Stuck-on\" appearance; waxy; no dimple sign\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a straightforward, clinically sound presentation with classic findings for a common benign skin lesion. No red flags or implausible elements.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Dermatofibroma\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"The positive dimple sign (surface retraction when squeezed) is pathognomonic for dermatofibroma.
