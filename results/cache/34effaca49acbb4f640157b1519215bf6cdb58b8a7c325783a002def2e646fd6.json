  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"sphenoid sinus\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"The transsphenoidal approach to pituitary adenomas is the standard surgical technique, accessing the pituitary gland through the sphenoid sinus. This is a well-established neurosurgical procedure where the surgeon goes through the nasal cavity, through the sphenoid sinus, to reach the sella turcica where the pituitary gland sits. The frontal sinus is located anteriorly in the forehead and would not provide appropriate access to the pituitary. The ethmoid sinus is also not the correct route. The cavernous sinus is a lateral structure that contains important neurovascular structures and is not the surgical corridor used.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
