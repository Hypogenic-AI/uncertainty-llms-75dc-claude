  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"C\", \"confidence\": 8, \"reasoning\": \"This patient presents with classic symptoms of pheochromocytoma: episodic severe headaches, palpitations, profuse sweating (diaphoresis), hypertension, tachycardia, and pallor. Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine-secreting tumors that typically arise from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. The adrenal gland has three main histological zones: the outer cortex (which has three layers: zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, and zona reticularis) and the inner medulla. In a typical histology slide of the adrenal gland, the medulla is located in the central region. Without seeing the actual figure, based on standard histology presentations where options progress from outer to inner regions, option C would typically represent the medullary region where chromaffin cells are located.\"}",
