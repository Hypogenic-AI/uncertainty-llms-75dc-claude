The question uses deliberately absurd and nonsensical language ('unfathomable', 'cosmic energy', 'power of a thousand suns') to describe impossible biological structures. There is no scientific basis for answering this question, as it involves entirely fabricated biology. The term 'residual body' has a real meaning in cell biology (remnants after certain cellular processes), but applying it to a fictional alien organelle makes no medical or scientific sense. This appears designed to elicit speculative fiction rather than medical knowledge.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
