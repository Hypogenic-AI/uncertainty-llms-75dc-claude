The most likely cause is antibodies directed against phospholipids (such as lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin antibodies), which cause a hypercoagulable state. The student's answer (antibodies against glycoprotein IIb/IIIa) is associated with immune thrombocytopenic purpura, not this presentation.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
