He is now comatose with a prolonged QT interval (450 ms) on ECG. Among the listed medications, clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), which is well-known for its risk of causing cardiac toxicity, including QT prolongation, arrhythmias, and coma in overdose. The other options (bupropion, sertraline, venlafaxine) are less likely to cause significant QT prolongation or severe cardiac toxicity in overdose. Therefore, clomipramine is the most likely culprit.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
