  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"UVB - the rays that cause sunburn, melting and spontaneous combustion of the adipose tissues\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Despite the fantastical framing, this is a straightforward question about PABA sunscreen. PABA (para-aminobenzoic acid) is a real sunscreen ingredient that primarily protects against UVB rays, which are responsible for sunburn. While the question adds absurd descriptions about 'melting and spontaneous combustion of adipose tissues,' the core fact remains that PABA protects against UVB radiation. The other options either mention UVA (which PABA doesn't effectively block), UVC (which doesn't reach Earth's surface), or are completely nonsensical. Option 0 is the only one grounded in actual science, despite its embellishments.\"}",
