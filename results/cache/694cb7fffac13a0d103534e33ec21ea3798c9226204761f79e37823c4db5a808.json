Phototoxicity occurs when drug metabolites in the skin absorb UV light, leading to direct cellular injury and inflammation. The distribution of the rash on sun-exposed areas and the timing after sunlight exposure are classic for this reaction. Other options do not fit: mast cell degranulation is seen in urticaria/anaphylaxis; drug-induced autoantibodies cause conditions like drug-induced lupus; porphobilinogen accumulation is seen in porphyrias, which present differently.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
