  "raw_response": "Looking at this question, I need to identify a drug that \"directly antagonizes the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways.\"\n\nLet me analyze the clinical scenario first:\n- 62-year-old with chronic bronchitis history\n- 20 pack-year smoking history (quit 5 years ago)\n- Worsening dyspnea and productive cough\n- Increased AP chest diameter (barrel chest)\n- Coarse crackles bilaterally\n\nThis presentation is consistent with COPD exacerbation.\n\nNow, examining the mechanism of action for each option:\n\n**Vagal stimulation effects on airways:**\n- Vagus nerve releases acetylcholine\n- Acetylcholine binds to muscarinic receptors (M3) on airway smooth muscle\n- This causes bronchoconstriction and increased mucus secretion\n\n**Drug analysis:**\n\n1. **Fluticasone** - Inhaled corticosteroid; reduces inflammation, not a direct vagal antagonist\n\n2. **Montelukast** - Leukotriene receptor antagonist; blocks leukotriene effects, not vagal effects\n\n3. **Tiotropium** - Long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA); directly blocks muscarinic receptors, thereby antagonizing acetylcholine released by vagal stimulation. This is a DIRECT antagonist of vagal effects.\n\n4. **Cromolyn** - Mast cell stabilizer; prevents mediator release, not a vagal antagonist\n\n**Evidence quality assessment:** This is a straightforward, medically sound COPD management question with a clear pharmacological focus. The scenario is realistic and the question tests understanding of bronchodilator mechanisms.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Tiotropium\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Tiotropium is a muscarinic antagonist that directly blocks acetylcholine receptors, thereby antagonizing vagal stimulation effects on airways. It's a first-line COPD treatment and the only option that directly antagonizes vagal effects.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
