Do you think it will not help?\\\"\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Therapeutic communication requires open-ended questions that encourage the patient to express concerns and feelings. Option 2 uses open-ended questions to explore the patient's specific worries about following the treatment, allowing for assessment of barriers and concerns. The student's answer (option 0) and options 1 and 3 are non-therapeutic because they dismiss concerns, provide false reassurance, or redirect authority rather than exploring the patient's perspective. Option 2 demonstrates active listening and facilitates problem-solving, which are key principles of therapeutic communication.\"}",
