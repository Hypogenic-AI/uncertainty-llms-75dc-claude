  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Clinical Scenario Analysis:**\n- High-voltage electrical injury (significant mechanism)\n- Witnessed seizure-like activity (\"arms and legs shaking\")\n- Now alert with severe bilateral flank pain + right arm pain\n- 6 cm burn on right arm (entry point)\n- Mild tachypnea, otherwise stable vitals\n\n**Key Concern - Bilateral Flank Pain:**\nThis is the critical finding. In electrical injuries, high-voltage current passing through the body can cause:\n- Rhabdomyolysis from muscle damage\n- Myoglobinuria leading to acute kidney injury\n- The bilateral flank pain suggests kidney involvement\n\n**Priority in Electrical Injuries:**\n1. Immediate assessment for rhabdomyolysis/myoglobinuria\n2. Prevention of acute renal failure (leading cause of death in electrical injury survivors)\n3. Early aggressive fluid resuscitation if myoglobinuria present\n\n**Evaluating Options:**\n- **FAST ultrasound**: For trauma/bleeding - not indicated here, vitals stable\n- **Urinalysis**: Would immediately detect myoglobinuria (tea/cola-colored urine), guiding urgent treatment\n- **X-ray**: Important but not immediately life-threatening; can wait\n- **EEG**: Not urgent; seizure already resolved, patient alert\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:**\nThis is a medically plausible, well-constructed clinical scenario consistent with high-voltage electrical injury presentation.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Urinalysis\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"In high-voltage electrical injury with bilateral flank pain, the priority is detecting myoglobinuria to prevent acute renal failure. Urinalysis is the fastest way to identify this life-threatening complication and guide immediate aggressive fluid resuscitation.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
