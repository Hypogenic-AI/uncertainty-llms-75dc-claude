Hull's drive-reduction theory of motivation. Hull's formula proposed that behavior (sEr) = Habit strength (sHr) \u00d7 Drive (D) \u00d7 Incentive (K). For behavior to occur, Hull's theory requires all three components: a learned habit, a drive/impulse (internal need state), and an incentive (external reward). Option 2, though worded absurdly, correctly identifies all three necessary components (habit, impulse, and incentive), making it the most accurate answer according to Hull's theory.\"}",
