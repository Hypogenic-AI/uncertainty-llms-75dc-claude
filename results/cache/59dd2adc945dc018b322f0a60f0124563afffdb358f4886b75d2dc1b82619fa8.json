  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Active hepatitis A infection\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"The presence of anti-HAV IgM (and absence of anti-HAV IgG) indicates an acute or recent hepatitis A infection. The hepatitis B serology (HBsAg negative, anti-HBs positive, anti-HBc negative) is consistent with immunity due to vaccination, not infection. All hepatitis C markers are negative. Thus, the best explanation is active hepatitis A infection.\"}",
