  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"The representation of the logarithm of the velocity constant versus the square root of the ionic force should be linear.\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This question relates to the Br\u00f8nsted-Bjerrum equation (or Debye-H\u00fcckel theory applied to reaction kinetics), which describes how ionic strength affects reaction rates for charged species. For a reaction involving charged species, the equation predicts that log(k) is linearly related to the square root of ionic strength (\u221aI). The relationship is: log(k) = log(k\u2080) + 2Z\u2090Z\u1d66A\u221aI, where Z\u2090 and Z\u1d66 are the charges of the reacting species. Since the student's answer (option 0) is incorrect and states ionic strength has no effect, and we know ionic strength DOES affect reactions of charged species, we can eliminate that. Option 3 correctly describes the linear relationship between log(k) and \u221aI, which is the fundamental relationship predicted by the theory.\"}",
