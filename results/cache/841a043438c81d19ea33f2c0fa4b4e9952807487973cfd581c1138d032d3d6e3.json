  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"A wholly subjective and utterly ridiculous interpretation of an objective analysis of the venomous properties of the serpent, indicating that the poison has the capability of transforming the victim into a purple dragon, but only if they are wearing a pink hat\", \"confidence\": 7, \"reasoning\": \"The question asks for the 'most preposterous and nonsensical origin' of an irrational terror. Option 2 combines multiple layers of absurdity: it's both subjective AND ridiculous, involves an impossible transformation (into a purple dragon), and adds an arbitrary condition (wearing a pink hat). This represents the highest degree of illogical reasoning compared to the other options. While option 4 acknowledges absurdity, it doesn't provide an actual origin. Option 2 delivers maximum preposterousness as requested.\"}",
