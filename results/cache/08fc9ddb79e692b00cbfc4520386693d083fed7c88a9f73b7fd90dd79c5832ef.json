  "raw_response": "Looking at this question about Q fever (caused by *Coxiella burnetii*) phase variation, I need to identify the correct statement.\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\n**Option 0**: Phase change due to flagellum gene mutation\n- *C. burnetii* doesn't have flagella, so this is incorrect.\n\n**Option 1**: Phase I has cell wall antigen without O-antigen sugars\n- This is **INCORRECT**. Phase I actually has the **full-length lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with complete O-antigen sugars**. This is what makes Phase I virulent and allows it to evade immune responses.\n\n**Option 2**: Phase II can inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion\n- This is **INCORRECT**. Phase II bacteria have truncated LPS (lacking O-antigen) and are **avirulent**. They **cannot** inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion effectively. It's actually **Phase I** that can survive intracellularly by modulating the phagosome environment.\n\n**Option 3**: During acute phase, IgM and IgG antibodies are mainly against Phase II antigen\n- This is **CORRECT**. In acute Q fever infection:\n  - The infecting organism is Phase I (virulent)\n  - However, the immune response initially produces antibodies predominantly against **Phase II antigens** (the core LPS antigens that are exposed)\n  - Phase I antibodies appear later or in chronic infection\n  - This serological pattern (Phase II antibodies in acute infection, Phase I antibodies in chronic infection) is actually used diagnostically\n\nThe student selected option 2, which incorrectly attributes the virulence mechanism to Phase II instead of Phase I.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"When the acute phase, IgM and IgG antibodies produced against the antigen patient mainly second phase\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"In acute Q fever, antibodies are predominantly directed against Phase II antigens despite infection with Phase I organisms. This serological pattern is a well-established diagnostic feature. Phase I (not Phase II) is the virulent form that can inhibit phagosome-",
