  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this clinical case systematically.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:**\nThis appears to be a legitimate medical case with:\n- Plausible clinical presentation (DVT post-trauma)\n- Consistent vital signs and physical findings\n- Appropriate diagnostic workup\n- Realistic laboratory values\n- Medically sound scenario\n\n**Clinical Analysis:**\n\nKey findings:\n1. **Patient profile**: 29-year-old female with SLE and history of spontaneous abortion\n2. **Presentation**: Left leg DVT (confirmed by Doppler ultrasound)\n3. **Lab findings**:\n   - Normal platelets (250,000/mm\u00b3)\n   - Normal PT (14 sec)\n   - Prolonged PTT (90 sec) - significantly elevated\n   - **Mixing study PTT remains prolonged (89 sec)** - critical finding\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe prolonged PTT that does NOT correct with mixing study indicates an **inhibitor** rather than a factor deficiency.\n\nCombined with:\n- SLE (autoimmune disease)\n- History of spontaneous abortion\n- Thrombosis (paradoxically, despite prolonged PTT)\n\nThis classic triad points to **Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS)**:\n- Lupus anticoagulant causes prolonged PTT in vitro\n- But causes thrombosis in vivo (paradoxical)\n- Associated with recurrent pregnancy loss\n- Common in SLE patients\n\n**Eliminating other options:**\n- Option 0: Anti-GpIIb/IIIa would cause thrombocytopenia (platelets are normal)\n- Option 2: Anti-endothelial antibodies aren't a recognized cause of this presentation\n- Option 3: Vitamin K deficiency would prolong PT and correct with mixing study\n\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Antibodies directed against phospholipids\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Classic antiphospholipid syndrome: SLE patient with thrombosis, pregnancy loss, prolonged PTT that doesn't correct with mixing study (lupus anticoagulant).
