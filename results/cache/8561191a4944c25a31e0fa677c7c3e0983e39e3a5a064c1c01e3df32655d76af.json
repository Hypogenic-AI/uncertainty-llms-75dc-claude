  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation:\n\n**Key Features:**\n- 6-year-old child\n- Episodes of screaming/crying at night\n- Inconsolable during episodes\n- Does not respond to parents\n- Episodes last ~20 minutes\n- Returns to sleep afterward\n- **No memory of events the next morning**\n\nThis is a classic description of **night terrors (sleep terrors)**, a parasomnia disorder.\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n**Option 0: \"Persistent into adulthood\"**\n- FALSE. Night terrors typically occur in children aged 3-12 years and usually resolve by adolescence. Only a small minority persist into adulthood.\n\n**Option 1: \"Occur only during non-REM sleep\"**\n- TRUE. Night terrors occur during **slow-wave sleep (Stage N3), which is non-REM sleep**, typically in the first third of the night. This is distinct from nightmares, which occur during REM sleep.\n\n**Option 2: \"Associated with child abuse\"**\n- FALSE. Night terrors are NOT specifically associated with child abuse. They are a benign developmental phenomenon, though stress can be a trigger.\n\n**Option 3: \"Associated with later development of mood disorder\"**\n- FALSE. Night terrors are not predictive of future mood disorders. They are a benign parasomnia.\n\nThe amnesia for the event is a key distinguishing feature that confirms these are night terrors occurring during deep non-REM sleep.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"They occur only during non-REM sleep\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Classic presentation of night terrors (sleep terrors) which occur during slow-wave (N3) non-REM sleep, typically in first third of night.
