  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Bishydroxy coumarin\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Vitamin K antagonists are drugs that inhibit the action of vitamin K, thereby interfering with the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors in the liver. Bishydroxy coumarin (also known as dicumarol) is a classic example of a vitamin K antagonist. The question asks what vitamin K antagonizes, and the correct answer is the drug that acts as a vitamin K antagonist, which is Bishydroxy coumarin. The student's answer was incorrect because vitamin K does not antagonize the production of clotting factors; rather, it is required for their synthesis.\"}",
