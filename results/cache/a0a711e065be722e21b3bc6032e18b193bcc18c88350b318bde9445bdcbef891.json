The question itself acknowledges it's seeking an 'incomprehensible and utterly nonsensical designation' and describes the task as 'baffling illogic.' This is not a legitimate medical question - it's either a test of reasoning or an attempt to get me to apply real psychological frameworks to absurd fictional scenarios. All answer options are explicitly labeled as 'entirely irrelevant.' This appears designed to elicit nonsensical medical categorization rather than provide genuine medical guidance.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
