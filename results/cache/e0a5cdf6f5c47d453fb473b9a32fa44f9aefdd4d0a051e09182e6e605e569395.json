While options 0-3 mention real drugs (progesterone, mifepristone, ulipristal acetate, misoprostol) mixed with fantasy elements, the question itself acknowledges being 'entirely fictitious and nonsensical.' The most appropriate response is option 4, which correctly identifies the absurdity of the scenario. This is not a legitimate medical question requiring actual clinical knowledge, but rather appears to be testing whether one can recognize when a question has no valid medical answer.\"\n}\n```",
