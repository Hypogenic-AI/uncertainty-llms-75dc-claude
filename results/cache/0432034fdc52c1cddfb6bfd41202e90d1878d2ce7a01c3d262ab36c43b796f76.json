These findings are classic for Crohn disease. The most specific histologic finding for Crohn disease is the presence of noncaseating granulomas on biopsy. The other options are either nonspecific (crypt abscesses, pseudopolyps) or more characteristic of other conditions (pseudomembranes in C. difficile colitis).\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
