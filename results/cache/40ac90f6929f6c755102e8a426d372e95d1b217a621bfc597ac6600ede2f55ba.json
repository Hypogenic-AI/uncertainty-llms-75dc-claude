  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation, I need to identify the likely diagnosis first, then determine which histological region corresponds to the cells producing this condition.\n\n**Clinical Analysis:**\n- 42-year-old man with episodic headaches, palpitations, and profuse sweating\n- Hypertension (163/112 mmHg) and tachycardia (112/min)\n- Pallor and perspiration on exam\n- Classic triad: headache, palpitations, sweating\n\nThis presentation is highly suggestive of **pheochromocytoma** - a catecholamine-secreting tumor.\n\n**Histological Correlation:**\nPheochromocytomas arise from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. In a typical adrenal gland histology slide:\n- **Outer cortex** (regions A, B, C): Contains three zones\n  - Zona glomerulosa (outermost)\n  - Zona fasciculata (middle)\n  - Zona reticularis (innermost)\n- **Inner medulla** (region E): Contains chromaffin cells that produce catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine)\n\nThe chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla are responsible for producing the catecholamines that cause this patient's symptoms. In standard histology slides labeled from outer to inner, the medulla would typically be labeled as the innermost region.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a straightforward clinical vignette with classic presentation of pheochromocytoma. The question is medically sound and evidence-based.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"E\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Classic presentation of pheochromocytoma (episodic headaches, palpitations, sweating, hypertension, tachycardia).
