  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Clinical Presentation:**\n- 21-year-old with major depressive disorder (3 years)\n- Medication with \"only slight improvement\"\n- Pill overdose \u2192 unconsciousness \u2192 coma\n- QT interval: 450 milliseconds (upper limit of normal, but significant in overdose context)\n\n**Key Consideration - QT Prolongation in Overdose:**\n\nThe critical clue is the QT interval measurement in the context of overdose and coma. Let me evaluate each option:\n\n1. **Clomipramine** (Tricyclic Antidepressant):\n   - TCAs are notorious for cardiotoxicity in overdose\n   - Cause QT prolongation, QRS widening, arrhythmias\n   - Can rapidly progress to coma and seizures\n   - Classic overdose presentation matches this case\n   - High toxicity profile (why less commonly prescribed now)\n\n2. **Sertraline** (SSRI):\n   - Generally safer in overdose\n   - Minimal cardiac effects\n   - Unlikely to cause rapid coma\n\n3. **Venlafaxine** (SNRI):\n   - Can cause seizures and serotonin syndrome in overdose\n   - Some cardiac effects but less pronounced than TCAs\n\n4. **Bupropion**:\n   - Main overdose concern is seizures\n   - Not typically associated with significant QT prolongation\n\n**Historical Context:**\nThe \"only slight improvement\" suggests an older medication that might not have been optimal - TCAs were commonly prescribed before SSRIs became first-line, and their partial efficacy with significant side effects fits this description.\n\n**Evidence Quality:** Normal - this is a classic toxicology presentation\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Clomipramine\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"TCA overdose classically presents with rapid progression to coma, cardiac conduction abnormalities including QT prolongation, and high mortality. The clinical scenario of partial treatment response followed by severe overdose with ECG changes is most consistent with clomipramine.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}\n```",
