  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Inhibition of P-glycoprotein\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Verapamil is a known inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, a transporter protein that facilitates the renal and biliary excretion of digoxin. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein by verapamil leads to reduced clearance and increased serum levels of digoxin, resulting in toxicity. The patient's symptoms and elevated digoxin level after starting verapamil support this mechanism. The other options are less likely: verapamil does not cause hypokalemia, does not significantly increase intestinal absorption of digoxin, and is not a significant inhibitor of CYP 3A4 for digoxin metabolism.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
