  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this question about techniques/methods based on behavioral sciences.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe question asks which technique is based on **behavioral sciences** (psychology, sociology, organizational behavior).\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n1. **Management by objectives (MBO)** - Developed by Peter Drucker, this is a management approach that involves setting clear objectives and evaluating performance. It heavily incorporates behavioral science principles including motivation theory, goal-setting theory, and participative management. This is fundamentally rooted in understanding human behavior in organizations.\n\n2. **Network analysis** - This is primarily a quantitative/mathematical technique (like PERT, CPM) used for project management and scheduling. It's based on operations research, not behavioral sciences.\n\n3. **Systems analysis** - This is an analytical approach focusing on how components of a system interact. It's based on systems theory and engineering principles, not primarily behavioral sciences.\n\n4. **Decision making** - While decision-making can involve behavioral aspects, as a general technique it encompasses various approaches including quantitative methods, operations research, and mathematical modeling. It's not exclusively or primarily a behavioral science technique.\n\n**Evidence Quality:** Normal - This is a straightforward question about management techniques and their theoretical foundations.\n\n**Correct Answer:** Management by objectives (Option 0) is the technique most fundamentally based on behavioral sciences, as it directly applies principles of human motivation, goal-setting, and organizational behavior.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Management by objectives\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"MBO is fundamentally based on behavioral science principles including motivation theory, goal-setting, and participative management.
