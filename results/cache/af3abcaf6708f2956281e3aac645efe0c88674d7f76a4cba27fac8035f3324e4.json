  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this clinical case systematically.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:**\nThis is a well-constructed, medically plausible case with classic presentation of a hemoglobinopathy. The clinical details are internally consistent and match established medical knowledge.\n\n**Clinical Analysis:**\n\nKey findings:\n- 6-year-old African American boy\n- Jaundice, normocytic anemia, severe bone pain\n- History of recurrent mild bone pain\n- Physical exam: icteric, swollen/tender/warm hands (dactylitis)\n- Labs:\n  - High total bilirubin (8.4 mg/dL) - hemolysis\n  - Anemia (Hgb 6.5 g/dL)\n  - Normal MCV (82.3 fL) - normocytic\n  - Elevated reticulocytes (7%) - hemolytic anemia\n  - Peripheral smear: elongated/curved cells (sickle cells) + Howell-Jolly bodies (nuclear remnants indicating splenic dysfunction)\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nThis is a classic presentation of **sickle cell disease**:\n- Vaso-occlusive crisis (bone pain, dactylitis)\n- Hemolytic anemia (jaundice, elevated bilirubin, reticulocytosis)\n- Sickle cells on peripheral smear\n- Age-appropriate presentation (symptoms typically begin after 6 months when HbF decreases)\n\n**Differential:**\n- Option 0 (Sickle cell trait): Usually asymptomatic, wouldn't cause this severe presentation\n- Option 2 (Hemoglobin F): Protective, not causative\n- Option 3 (HbC): Milder disease, different smear findings\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Sickle cell disease\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Classic presentation with vaso-occlusive crisis, hemolytic anemia, sickle cells on smear, and Howell-Jolly bodies.
