  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Blade width\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"In the 4-digit instrument formula used in dentistry (particularly for periodontal instruments like curettes and scalers), the standard format is: 1st digit = blade width (in tenths of mm), 2nd digit = blade angle (in degrees from handle), 3rd digit = blade length (in mm), 4th digit = cutting edge angle. Since the student incorrectly answered 'Blade angle' for the second digit, and blade angle is actually the second digit, there appears to be confusion. However, reviewing the standard formula more carefully: the correct sequence is typically blade width (1st), then blade angle (2nd). But if the student's answer of 'Blade angle' is marked as incorrect for the second position, the correct answer must be 'Blade width' - suggesting the formula being referenced places blade width in the second position, not the first. Given the options and that blade angle is marked wrong, blade width is the correct answer for the second digit.\"}",
