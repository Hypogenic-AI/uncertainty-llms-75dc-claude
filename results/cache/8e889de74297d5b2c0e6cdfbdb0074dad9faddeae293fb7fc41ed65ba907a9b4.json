  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Renzapride\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"The question asks about drugs acting on 5-HT4 receptors. Loxiglumide is a CCK receptor antagonist, not a 5-HT4 agent. Atractiloside is a mitochondrial toxin. Metoclopramide has some 5-HT4 agonist activity but is primarily a D2 antagonist. Renzapride is a well-known 5-HT4 receptor agonist (also has 5-HT3 antagonist properties) used for gastrointestinal motility disorders. This is the correct answer.\"}",
