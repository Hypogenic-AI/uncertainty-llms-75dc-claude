The question itself acknowledges being 'preposterous', 'illogical', and 'nonsensical'. This is not a legitimate medical question but rather appears designed to elicit speculative responses about impossible scenarios. All answer options are equally fictional and absurd. As a medical expert, I cannot provide meaningful medical guidance on fictional alien physiology and non-existent vitamins.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
