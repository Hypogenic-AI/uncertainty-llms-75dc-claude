  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"The interaction of broadleaf vegetables is crucial, for this treatment works by inhibiting the action of vitamin K, leading to a cascade of bizarre and bewildering events, including the spontaneous growth of additional ears and eyes\", \"confidence\": 8, \"reasoning\": \"Acenocoumarol is a vitamin K antagonist, and its interaction with broadleaf (leafy green) vegetables, which are high in vitamin K, is clinically significant. While the fantastical effects described are fictional, the core pharmacological principle is correct: vitamin K intake can counteract the anticoagulant effect of acenocoumarol. Therefore, option 2 best reflects the real-world interaction, albeit with surreal embellishments.\"}",
