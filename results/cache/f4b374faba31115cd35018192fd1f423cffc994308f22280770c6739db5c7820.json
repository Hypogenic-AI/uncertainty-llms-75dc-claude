  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Clinical Presentation:**\n- 10-year-old boy with acute onset inability to walk\n- Ascending weakness (severe in lower extremities)\n- Paresthesias in hands and feet\n- Areflexia (absent knee and ankle reflexes)\n- Mild sensory loss\n- Recent respiratory infection (3 weeks ago)\n\n**Key Laboratory Findings:**\n- CSF: Protein 91 mg/dL (elevated), WBC 2/mm\u00b3 (normal), glucose 60 mg/dL (normal)\n- This is **albuminocytologic dissociation** - classic for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS)\n- Normal CK rules out myopathy\n- Normal CBC\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a textbook presentation of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome with medically sound, internally consistent findings. The timeline, clinical features, and lab results all align perfectly with established medical knowledge.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS)\n- Post-infectious autoimmune polyneuropathy\n- Ascending paralysis with areflexia\n- Albuminocytologic dissociation on LP\n- Follows respiratory infection by 1-3 weeks\n\n**Treatment Options Analysis:**\n- **IVIG**: First-line treatment for GBS, especially in children with rapidly progressive weakness\n- **Prednisone**: Not effective for GBS; may worsen outcomes\n- **Botulism antitoxin**: Wrong diagnosis (botulism presents with descending paralysis, cranial nerve involvement, and different CSF findings)\n- **Gabapentin**: Symptomatic treatment for neuropathic pain, not primary therapy\n\nThe most appropriate next step is IVIG, which along with plasmapheresis, is standard first-line treatment for GBS.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Classic Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome with ascending paralysis, areflexia, and albuminocytologic dissociation following respiratory infection.",
