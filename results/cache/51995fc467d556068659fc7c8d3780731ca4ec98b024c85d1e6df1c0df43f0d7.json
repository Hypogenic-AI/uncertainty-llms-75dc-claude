In the real condition, young people are actually MORE susceptible, not less susceptible, making option 0 the erroneous statement. The question asks which statement would be considered an 'error' - option 0 contradicts the typical epidemiology where adolescents and young adults are most commonly affected due to increased sebaceous gland activity. However, the highly fictional framing and 'alien world' context makes this somewhat uncertain, as the question may be testing recognition of the inverted truth.\"}",
