The premise is scientifically nonsensical - S. mutans is a terrestrial organism that evolved specifically in human oral environments. Applying Earth-based bacterial colony counts to imaginary alien life forms has no scientific basis. The question appears designed to elicit speculation about impossible scenarios rather than provide legitimate medical information.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
