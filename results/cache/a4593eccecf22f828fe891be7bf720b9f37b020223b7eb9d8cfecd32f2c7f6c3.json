  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"To ensure that the two groups will be similar in prognostic factors according to the mystical cosmic forces of fate\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Despite the elaborate cosmic language, this is a straightforward question about randomization in clinical trials. The primary purpose of randomization is to ensure that treatment groups are balanced with respect to both known and unknown prognostic factors, minimizing selection bias and confounding. This allows for valid causal inference about treatment effects. Option 0, when stripped of its mystical language, correctly identifies this fundamental principle - randomization creates groups that are similar in prognostic factors through the mechanism of chance (humorously called 'cosmic forces of fate'). The other options describe either prevention of bias (option 1, partially correct but not primary purpose), statistical inference (option 2, a consequence not purpose), prediction (option 3, incorrect), or admission of ignorance (options 4-5, incorrect).\"}",
