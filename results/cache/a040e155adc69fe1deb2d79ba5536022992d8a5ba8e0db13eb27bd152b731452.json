  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Low levels of parathyroid hormone in serum\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"The newborn has characteristic facial features (micrognathia, broad nasal bridge, short philtrum, low-set ears, cleft palate) and a congenital heart defect (single overriding great vessel, likely truncus arteriosus), which are classic findings in DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion). DiGeorge syndrome is associated with hypoplasia of the parathyroid glands, leading to hypocalcemia and low parathyroid hormone levels. The other options do not fit the clinical scenario: double bubble sign is seen in duodenal atresia (not described here), chromosome 5p deletion causes cri-du-chat syndrome (different features), and bilateral cataracts are not a feature of DiGeorge syndrome.\"}",
