  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"A writhing mass of Lysosomes, surging with the power of a thousand suns\", \"confidence\": 2, \"reasoning\": \"This question appears to be testing knowledge of cellular biology using fantastical language. A 'residual body' in cellular biology refers to the leftover material after lysosomal digestion, containing indigestible materials. Residual bodies are formed when lysosomes digest cellular components but cannot break down certain materials completely. Despite the surreal framing about an alien organelle called 'Klaatu,' the question is asking what a residual body would resemble. The answer that mentions lysosomes (option 3) is the most biologically accurate, as residual bodies are indeed associated with lysosomal activity. However, given the highly fantastical nature of the question and the possibility that this is entirely hypothetical, my confidence is low.\"}",
