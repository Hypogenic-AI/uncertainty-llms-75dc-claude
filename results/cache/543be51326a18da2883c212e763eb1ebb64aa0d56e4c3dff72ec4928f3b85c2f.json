The patient has detectable viral load after missing medications every other day. The most appropriate response uses open-ended, non-judgmental exploration of barriers to adherence. This approach (option 0) follows best practices in patient-centered care by: 1) avoiding assumptions about why adherence is poor, 2) not being condescending (unlike option 1), 3) exploring root causes before jumping to solutions (unlike options 2-3), and 4) building therapeutic alliance. The patient's socioeconomic factors suggest multiple potential barriers (financial, social, psychological) that need exploration before intervention.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"\n}\n```",
