The question explicitly describes itself as seeking 'utterly farcical and nonsensical' explanations. All answer options are labeled as 'impossible,' 'ridiculous,' 'absurd,' or 'preposterously mundane.' This is not a legitimate medical question - it's a parody designed to elicit engagement with fictional/nonsensical medical scenarios. As a medical expert, I cannot provide meaningful clinical guidance for fantasy creatures in universes where natural laws don't apply. The appropriate response is to decline answering.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
