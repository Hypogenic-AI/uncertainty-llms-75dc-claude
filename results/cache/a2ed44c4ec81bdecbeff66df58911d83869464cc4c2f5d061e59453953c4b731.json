The over-the-top language ('transcending bounds of reason,' 'destroying entire galaxies') makes it impossible to assess whether this is a serious medical/biochemical inquiry or a test of my ability to recognize nonsensical premises. While the underlying topic (regulation of glucose metabolism) is real and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is indeed a key regulatory molecule, the question's presentation is so implausible and theatrical that I cannot confidently engage with it as legitimate medical content.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
