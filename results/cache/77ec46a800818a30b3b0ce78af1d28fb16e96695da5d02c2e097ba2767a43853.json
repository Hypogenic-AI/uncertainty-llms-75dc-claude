The student incorrectly selected 'record of cigarette consumption' (option 3), which IS actually a psychological/behavioral technique (self-monitoring). The correct answer is 'monitoring of biological parameters' (option 2) because this is a physiological/medical measurement technique (like CO levels, cotinine tests), not a psychological intervention. Shiffman's problem-solving training (option 0), contingency contracts (option 1), and cigarette consumption records (option 3) are all established psychological/behavioral techniques in smoking cessation.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
