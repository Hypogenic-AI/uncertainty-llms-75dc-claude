  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Conservative treatment by observation and antibiotic / antiseptic prophylaxis.\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Grade II vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in a 2-year-old is considered low-grade reflux. The standard initial management for low-grade VUR (grades I-III), especially in young children, is conservative treatment with observation and antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent urinary tract infections while allowing for spontaneous resolution, which occurs in a high percentage of cases. Surgical interventions (endoscopic injection, open or laparoscopic reimplantation) are typically reserved for higher grades of reflux (IV-V), breakthrough infections despite prophylaxis, or failure of conservative management. The student's answer of laparoscopic reimplantation is overly aggressive for initial management of grade II VUR.\"}",
