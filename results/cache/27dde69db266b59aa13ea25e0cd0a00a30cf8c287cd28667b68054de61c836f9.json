These are classic signs of necrotizing fasciitis, a rapidly progressive soft tissue infection that is a surgical emergency. The next best step is immediate surgical debridement and empiric broad-spectrum IV antibiotics. Delay in surgical intervention increases mortality. Imaging or biopsy should not delay treatment.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
