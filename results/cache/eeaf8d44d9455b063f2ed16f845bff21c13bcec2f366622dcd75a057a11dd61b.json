This is characteristic of a lacunar stroke, which is most commonly caused by lipohyalinosis of small penetrating arteries due to chronic hypertension and diabetes. There is no evidence of large vessel disease, embolic source, or hemorrhage. The student's answer (carotid stenosis) is incorrect because large vessel disease typically causes cortical deficits and not isolated thalamic lacunar infarcts.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
