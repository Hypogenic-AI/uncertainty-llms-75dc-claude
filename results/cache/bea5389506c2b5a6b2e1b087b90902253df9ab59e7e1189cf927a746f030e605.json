His renal biopsy shows eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation, which are classic findings for tubulointerstitial nephritis. Chronic use of NSAIDs and other analgesics can cause toxic (drug-induced) tubulointerstitial nephritis, leading to progressive renal dysfunction, mild proteinuria, and the described biopsy findings. There is no evidence of glomerular disease (e.g., FSGS), and the urinalysis is not consistent with acute tubular necrosis.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
