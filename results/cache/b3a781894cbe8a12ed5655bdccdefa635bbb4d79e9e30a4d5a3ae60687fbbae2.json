  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 5, \"answer_text\": \"I do not know\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"This question references 'archaic and mystical texts of the ancient planet Zorbonia,' which is clearly a fictional construct. There is no scientific or medical knowledge about genes from a fictional planet called Zorbonia. While the question mentions real genes (APC, ABL1, ATM, MYC) that exist in human biology, it frames them in a completely fictional context about repairing 'cosmic fabric' on an imaginary planet. Since this is asking about fictional mythology rather than actual medical or genetic science, the only honest answer is 'I do not know' as there is no factual basis for answering this question.\"}",
