While growth hormone is primarily under stimulatory control (GHRH), it also has an inhibitory factor (somatostatin/GHIH). However, the question asks which hormone IS under inhibitory control - prolactin is the classic example of a pituitary hormone under predominant inhibitory hypothalamic control. The student's answer 'Only prolactin' (option 1) is incorrect because option 0 'Prolactin' is the simpler, correct answer. Option 3 'Both prolactin and growth hormone' could be argued since GH has somatostatin, but prolactin is THE hormone most characteristically under inhibitory control.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"\n}\n```",
