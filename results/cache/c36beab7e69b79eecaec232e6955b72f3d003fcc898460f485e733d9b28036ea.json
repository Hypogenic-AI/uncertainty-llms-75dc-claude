  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation systematically:\n\n**Clinical Picture:**\n- 39-year-old woman with fever (40\u00b0C), chills, fatigue for 1 week\n- Right-sided abdominal pain, nausea\n- Tender hepatomegaly (liver 2-3 cm below costal margin)\n- Decreased breath sounds at right lung base\n- Tachycardia (118/min)\n\n**Laboratory Findings:**\n- Leukocytosis (17,100/mm\u00b3) with neutrophilia (74%)\n- Elevated alkaline phosphatase (180 U/L)\n- Mildly elevated transaminases (AST 69, ALT 100)\n- Normal bilirubin (0.9 mg/dL)\n\n**Key Clinical Indicators:**\nThis presentation is highly suggestive of a **pyogenic liver abscess**:\n- High fever with systemic toxicity\n- Tender hepatomegaly\n- Leukocytosis with neutrophilia\n- Elevated alkaline phosphatase (cholestatic pattern)\n- Right pleural involvement (decreased breath sounds suggesting sympathetic effusion)\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n1. **Discontinue oral contraceptive** - While OCPs can be associated with hepatic adenomas, this acute febrile presentation with leukocytosis indicates infection, not a hormonal complication.\n\n2. **HIDA scan** - Used for cholecystitis/biliary obstruction. The normal bilirubin makes biliary obstruction unlikely.\n\n3. **ERCP** - For biliary tree pathology. Not indicated without evidence of choledocholithiasis or biliary obstruction.\n\n4. **Percutaneous drainage** - The definitive treatment for pyogenic liver abscess includes antibiotics AND drainage (for abscesses >5cm or those not responding to antibiotics alone).\n\nGiven the ultrasound is mentioned (likely showing a liver abscess), the most appropriate next step is therapeutic intervention.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Perform percutaneous drainage\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Classic presentation of pyogenic liver abscess with high fever, tender",
