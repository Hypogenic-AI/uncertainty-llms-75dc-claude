  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Performing the preposterous Javal Schiotz method, where the thickness of the cornea is measured by dropping a lead weight from a tower, and observing the reaction of the cornea to the sudden impact, while the court jester narrates the proceedings in an exaggerated manner\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"The Javal Schiotz method is actually a tonometry technique for measuring intraocular pressure, not corneal thickness. Dropping a lead weight from a tower is not a recognized method for measuring corneal thickness, even in whimsical or fantastical contexts. The other options, while described fancifully, are based on real corneal thickness measurement techniques (OCT, ultrasound pachymetry, Orbscan).\"}",
