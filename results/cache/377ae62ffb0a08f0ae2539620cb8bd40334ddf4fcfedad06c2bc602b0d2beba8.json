While she is a non-smoker, squamous cell carcinoma is a classic cause of hemoptysis and often presents as a central or apical mass with irregular borders. Sarcoidosis typically presents with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, not a solitary nodule. Carcinoid tumors are less likely to cause significant weight loss and are usually centrally located. Adenocarcinoma is more common in non-smokers and women, but it typically presents as a peripheral nodule. The combination of symptoms and radiographic findings most closely fits squamous cell carcinoma, despite the absence of smoking history.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
