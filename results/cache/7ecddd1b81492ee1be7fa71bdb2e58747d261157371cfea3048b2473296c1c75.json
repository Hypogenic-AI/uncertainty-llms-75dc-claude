  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Risk of disuse syndrome.\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"The definition describes vulnerability to deterioration of body systems due to prescribed or inevitable musculoskeletal inactivity. This precisely matches 'Risk of disuse syndrome,' which addresses complications from immobility. 'Intolerance to activity' refers to insufficient energy for activities, not the consequences of inactivity. 'Impairment of ambulation' is about difficulty walking, and 'Risk of trauma' concerns injury risk. The key phrases 'vulnerable to deterioration' and 'musculoskeletal inactivity' definitively point to disuse syndrome.\"}",
