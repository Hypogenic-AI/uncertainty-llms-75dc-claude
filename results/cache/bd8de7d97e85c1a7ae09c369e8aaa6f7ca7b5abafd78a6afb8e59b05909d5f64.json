  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Clomipramine\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose: unconsciousness, history of depression, and an ECG showing QT prolongation. Clomipramine is a TCA, which are known for their cardiotoxicity (including QT prolongation) and high lethality in overdose. The other medications listed (bupropion, sertraline, venlafaxine) are less likely to cause significant QT prolongation and coma in overdose. Therefore, clomipramine is the most likely culprit.\"}",
