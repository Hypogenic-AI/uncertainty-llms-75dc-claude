  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this clinical presentation systematically.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a straightforward, medically plausible case presentation with classic clinical findings. Nothing suspicious or dangerous.\n\n**Clinical Analysis:**\n\nKey features:\n- 60-year-old postmenopausal woman (menopause at 52)\n- Severe vulvar itching for 1 year, progressively worsening\n- Dyspareunia (painful intercourse)\n- Physical findings:\n  - Dry, thin, WHITE plaque-like lesions\n  - Vulvar atrophy with atrophy of labia minora\n  - Retracted clitoris\n  - Pale, wrinkled perianal skin (\"figure-of-8\" pattern)\n\n**Differential Analysis:**\n\n1. **Lichen sclerosus**: Classic presentation\n   - Postmenopausal women most affected\n   - White, atrophic, parchment-like plaques\n   - \"Figure-of-8\" or \"keyhole\" distribution (vulvar + perianal)\n   - Clitoral resorption/retraction\n   - Severe pruritus and dyspareunia\n   - **This fits perfectly**\n\n2. **Squamous cell hyperplasia**: Typically shows thickened, not thin/atrophic skin\n\n3. **Squamous cell carcinoma**: Would show ulceration, masses, or nodules rather than diffuse white plaques\n\n4. **Lichen planus**: Usually shows violaceous (purple) papules, erosions, and Wickham striae, not the white atrophic changes described\n\n**Diagnosis:** The combination of white atrophic plaques, clitoral retraction, perianal involvement, and severe pruritus in a postmenopausal woman is pathognomonic for lichen sclerosus.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Lichen sclerosus\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Classic presentation with white atrophic plaques, clitoral retraction, figure-of-8 distribution involving perianal area, severe pruritus, and dyspareunia in postmenopausal woman",
