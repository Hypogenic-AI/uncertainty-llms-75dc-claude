  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Glycosidic bonds\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Miglitol is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor used in diabetes management. Alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the small intestine cleave glycosidic bonds in complex carbohydrates and disaccharides to produce monosaccharides for absorption. By inhibiting these enzymes, miglitol prevents the breakdown of glycosidic bonds, thereby slowing carbohydrate digestion and reducing postprandial glucose spikes. The instruction to take it with the first bite of a meal is consistent with its mechanism of action. This is a straightforward, medically sound question about a legitimate diabetes medication.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
