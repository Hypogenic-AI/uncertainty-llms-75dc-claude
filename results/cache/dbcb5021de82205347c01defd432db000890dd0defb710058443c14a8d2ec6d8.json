  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 4, \"answer_text\": \"Conceding defeat in the face of this utter absurdity and admitting ignorance to the baffling illogic of the situation, for it defies the very foundations of reason and sanity\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"This question is entirely fictional and nonsensical, involving a mythical city (Atlantis), an imaginary disease (Siren Syndrome), and irrational treatment options that have no basis in medical science. The question explicitly asks for an 'irrational, illogical, and nonsensical' answer to a 'fantastical malady.' None of the drug options have any logical connection to treating a non-existent condition. The most appropriate response is to acknowledge that this scenario defies medical reasoning entirely. Option 4 correctly identifies the absurdity of attempting to provide a rational medical answer to an inherently irrational premise.\"}",
