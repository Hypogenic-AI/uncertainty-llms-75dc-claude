  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this clinical case systematically.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a standard, medically plausible clinical presentation with realistic patient demographics, symptoms, and examination findings. Nothing appears suspicious or dangerous.\n\n**Clinical Analysis:**\n\nKey features:\n- 65-year-old male with sedentary lifestyle\n- Difficulty with overhead activities (combing hair, reaching high shelves)\n- Risk factors: diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, sedentary lifestyle\n- **Decreased BOTH passive AND active range of motion**\n- Strength 4/5 (near normal)\n\n**Differential consideration:**\n\n1. **Adhesive capsulitis (Frozen shoulder):**\n   - Classic presentation: restricted passive AND active ROM\n   - Strong association with diabetes mellitus\n   - Typically affects sedentary individuals\n   - Gradual onset of stiffness\n   - This fits BEST\n\n2. **Rotator cuff impingement:**\n   - Would show ACTIVE ROM limitation > passive ROM\n   - Typically painful arc of motion\n   - Doesn't match the equal passive/active restriction\n\n3. **Glenohumeral osteoarthritis:**\n   - Less common than adhesive capsulitis\n   - Would expect more pain description\n   - Possible but less likely given the presentation\n\n4. **Subacromial bursitis:**\n   - Primarily painful, not stiff\n   - Active ROM more affected than passive\n   - Doesn't fit the presentation\n\nThe **key distinguishing feature** is the equal restriction of passive and active ROM, which is pathognomonic for adhesive capsulitis. Combined with diabetes as a major risk factor, this is the most likely diagnosis.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Adhesive capsulitis\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Equal restriction of passive and active ROM is characteristic of adhesive capsulitis. Strong risk factors present include diabetes mellitus and sedentary lifestyle. This distinguishes it from rotator cuff pathology which primarily affects active ROM.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
