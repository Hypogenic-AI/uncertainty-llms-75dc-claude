  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"A patently absurd and impossible low blood phosphorous level, as if the very rules of the reality were being warped by unseen magical forces\", \"confidence\": 7, \"reasoning\": \"Despite the whimsical framing, this appears to be asking about bow-legs (genu varum) when rickets is suspected but initial tests are inconclusive. In rickets, while calcium may be normal or low, the key laboratory findings are typically low phosphorus and elevated alkaline phosphatase. Hypophosphatemic rickets (like X-linked hypophosphatemia) presents with low serum phosphorus but normal calcium and normal or elevated alkaline phosphatase. This would explain bow-legs with 'normal' initial rickets screening but abnormal phosphorus levels. The question's theatrical language suggests looking for the 'unexpected' finding that would still explain rickets - which would be isolated hypophosphatemia.\"}",
