The renal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles, which are classic for cholesterol clefts (emboli). Cholesterol embolization is a known complication after vascular procedures, especially in older patients with atherosclerosis. The presence of eosinophilia and elevated ESR further supports this diagnosis. The other options do not fit the clinical scenario as well.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
