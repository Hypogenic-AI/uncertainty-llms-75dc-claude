  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this medical question systematically.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a standard, medically plausible prenatal care scenario. The clinical presentation is realistic and follows normal medical practice patterns.\n\n**Clinical Analysis:**\n\nKey findings:\n- 22-year-old primigravida at 16 weeks gestation\n- Home dipstick: 1+ glucose in urine\n- Increased urinary frequency\n- Normal vital signs and physical exam\n- **Fasting glucose: 97 mg/dL (NORMAL - reference <100 mg/dL)**\n- Normal liver and kidney function\n- BMI 25.6 kg/m\u00b2 (slightly overweight but reasonable)\n\n**Critical Point:** Glucosuria (glucose in urine) during pregnancy is COMMON and often physiological due to:\n1. Increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR)\n2. Decreased renal threshold for glucose reabsorption\n3. These are normal pregnancy adaptations\n\n**Why each option is right or wrong:**\n\n1. **HbA1c** (Student's incorrect answer): Not indicated because fasting glucose is normal (97 mg/dL). HbA1c reflects long-term glucose control and wouldn't add value here.\n\n2. **No tests required**: The fasting glucose is normal, making gestational diabetes unlikely. Glucosuria in pregnancy with normal blood glucose is typically physiological and requires no further testing.\n\n3. **Urinalysis**: Could rule out UTI, but patient has no symptoms (no fever, no CVA tenderness, normal vitals). Not the primary concern here.\n\n4. **Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)**: Standard screening for gestational diabetes is done at 24-28 weeks, not at 16 weeks, and only if there are risk factors or abnormal glucose levels.\n\n**Correct Answer:** No tests required - physiological glucosuria with normal fasting glucose.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"No tests required\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Patient has physiological glucosuria of pregnancy with normal fasting glucose (97 mg/dL). This is a common benign finding due to increased GFR and decreased re",
