While there IS a real medical association between C4 complement deficiency and SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), the question's presentation is so fantastical and potentially designed to elicit answers to nonsensical scenarios that I cannot confidently engage with it. The dramatic, sensationalized language and impossible physiological descriptions (stares causing paralysis, atmospheric transformation) indicate this is not a genuine medical inquiry.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"dangerous\"\n}\n```",
