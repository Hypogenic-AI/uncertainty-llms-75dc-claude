It is specifically FDA-approved for treating chronic gout in adult patients who are refractory to conventional therapy. It is not used for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or paralytic ileus. The student's answer of 'Rheumatoid arthritis' is incorrect; the correct answer is 'Chronic gout.'\"}",
