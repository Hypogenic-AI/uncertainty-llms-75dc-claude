  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Para-aminohippurate\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"The substance described is not reabsorbed and its excretion rate increases with plasma concentration up to a point, then plateaus. This pattern is characteristic of a substance that is both filtered and secreted by the tubules, with secretion saturating at higher concentrations. Para-aminohippurate (PAH) is classically used to measure renal plasma flow and exhibits this exact behavior. Glucose is incorrect because it is reabsorbed until the transport maximum is reached, and cystatin C and iohexol are used to estimate GFR, not RPF, and do not show secretion saturation.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
