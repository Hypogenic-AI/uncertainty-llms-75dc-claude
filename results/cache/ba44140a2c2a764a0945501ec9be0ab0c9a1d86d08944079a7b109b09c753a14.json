  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation, I need to assess the evidence quality and clinical scenario:\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This appears to be a legitimate medical case describing necrotizing fasciitis (necrotizing soft tissue infection) in a high-risk patient. The clinical features are classic and medically sound:\n- Severe pain out of proportion to exam findings (hallmark sign)\n- Crepitus (gas in tissues)\n- Foul-smelling discharge\n- Systemic toxicity (fever, tachycardia, hypotension)\n- High-risk patient (recent surgery, diabetes, immunosuppressed from steroids)\n\n**Clinical Analysis:**\nThis patient has necrotizing fasciitis, a surgical emergency. Key diagnostic features:\n1. Pain out of proportion to physical findings\n2. Crepitus (indicating gas-forming organisms)\n3. Systemic toxicity\n4. Rapid progression\n5. Risk factors: recent CABG, diabetes, corticosteroid use\n\n**Management Priority:**\nNecrotizing fasciitis requires IMMEDIATE surgical debridement plus broad-spectrum IV antibiotics. This is a life-threatening condition with mortality rates of 20-40% that increase significantly with delayed treatment.\n\n- Option 0 (debridement alone): Incomplete - antibiotics are essential\n- Option 1 (debridement + antibiotics): CORRECT - addresses both surgical source control and infection\n- Option 2 (biopsy): Dangerous delay in a surgical emergency\n- Option 3 (CT chest/abdomen): Wrong anatomic area and delays definitive treatment\n\nThe standard of care is emergent surgical debridement combined with empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics covering gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Immediate debridement and empiric IV antibiotics\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Classic presentation of necrotizing fasciitis with pain out of proportion to exam, crepitus, and systemic toxicity.
