Type II collagen is primarily found in hyaline cartilage (option 0), nucleus pulposus (option 2), and vertebral endplates (option 3). The meniscus, however, is composed primarily of Type I collagen (fibrocartilage), not Type II collagen. Therefore, the meniscus is the tissue NOT primarily constituted of Type II collagen.\"}",
