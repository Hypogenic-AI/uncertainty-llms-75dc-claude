The question itself acknowledges this by describing the scenario as 'fantastical,' 'utterly surreal,' 'perplexing,' 'inexplicable,' and 'utterly ludicrous.' All the treatment options (0-3) are equally nonsensical and impossible. Option 4 is the most intellectually honest answer as it recognizes that this is a meaningless question with no legitimate medical answer. As a medical expert, I cannot provide a serious medical recommendation for a completely fictional, impossible scenario. Option 5 ('I do not know') would also be reasonable, but Option 4 better captures the fundamental absurdity of the premise.\"\n}\n```",
