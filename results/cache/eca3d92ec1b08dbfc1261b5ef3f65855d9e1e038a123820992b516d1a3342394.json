The options are written in intentionally confusing, pseudo-mystical language that obscures any legitimate medical content. While option 3 contains elements that vaguely relate to actual allergy testing (antibodies to antigens), the entire premise is nonsensical and appears designed to elicit medical information in an inappropriate context. This is not a legitimate medical question deserving a confident answer.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
