Gastric adenocarcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor originating from the gastric mucosa epithelium and represents ~90-95% of gastric cancers. Carcinoid tumors are neuroendocrine tumors (not epithelial origin), lymphomas are lymphoid/hematopoietic tumors, and GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumors) are mesenchymal tumors arising from interstitial cells of Cajal. Only gastric adenocarcinoma is truly epithelial in origin.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
