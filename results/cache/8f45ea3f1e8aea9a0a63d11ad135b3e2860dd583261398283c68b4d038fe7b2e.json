  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- Recent travel to Madagascar\n- Painless red papules on left thigh (likely flea bites)\n- Severe painful inguinal lymphadenopathy (bubonic presentation)\n- Fever and systemic symptoms\n- Gram-negative coccobacilli in lymph node aspirate\n- 4-fold rise in anti-F1 titers\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nThe anti-F1 antibody is specific for the F1 capsular antigen of *Yersinia pestis*. Combined with:\n- Endemic area (Madagascar is a plague-endemic region)\n- Classic bubonic plague presentation (painful \"buboes\")\n- Gram-negative coccobacilli\n- Positive serology\n\nThis is **plague** (bubonic form).\n\n**Treatment Options Analysis:**\n\n**Streptomycin** has historically been the gold standard treatment for plague:\n- Aminoglycoside with excellent activity against *Y. pestis*\n- FDA-approved for plague\n- Recommended by WHO and CDC as first-line therapy\n- Typically given 15 mg/kg IM twice daily for 10 days\n\n**Azithromycin**: While it has some activity and may be used in mild cases or as an alternative, it is not first-line therapy for severe plague.\n\n**Imipenem**: Not standard treatment for plague; aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, or doxycycline are preferred.\n\n**No pharmacotherapy**: Would be inappropriate - untreated plague has very high mortality.\n\nGiven the severe presentation with systemic symptoms and the confirmed diagnosis, the most appropriate first-line treatment is streptomycin.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Streptomycin\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This is a classic case of bubonic plague confirmed by anti-F1 antibodies, endemic location (Madagascar), and clinical presentation. Streptomycin is the gold standard first-line treatment for plague recommended by WHO and CDC, particularly for severe cases like this one.\"}",
