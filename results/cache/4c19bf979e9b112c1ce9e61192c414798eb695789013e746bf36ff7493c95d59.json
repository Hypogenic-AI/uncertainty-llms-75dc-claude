She quickly regained full orientation, and there are no abnormal findings on exam or ECG (an incomplete right bundle branch block can be a normal variant in young adults). The brief, jerky movements are consistent with myoclonic activity sometimes seen in syncope. No evidence suggests orthostatic hypotension, arrhythmia, or structural heart disease.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
