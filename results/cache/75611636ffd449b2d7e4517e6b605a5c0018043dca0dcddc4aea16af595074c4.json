These are not medically plausible scenarios. The question appears designed to parody SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) criteria with nonsensical values that have no basis in real physiology or medicine. Since the entire premise is fantastical and the parameters are physically impossible, I cannot provide legitimate medical guidance.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"implausible\"\n}\n```",
