  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this clinical case systematically.\n\n**Clinical Presentation Analysis:**\n- 23-year-old female ballet dancer with low BMI (17 kg/m\u00b2)\n- Progressive fatigue\n- Painful knee swelling with bloody synovial fluid (hemarthrosis)\n- Gingival bleeding and swelling\n- Perifollicular petechiae\n- Prolonged bleeding time (11 min; normal <10 min)\n- Normal PT and aPTT\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a medically plausible case presentation with classic findings that form a coherent clinical picture.\n\n**Diagnosis:** This constellation of findings strongly suggests **scurvy (Vitamin C deficiency)**:\n- Perifollicular hemorrhages (pathognomonic)\n- Gingival bleeding/swelling\n- Hemarthrosis\n- Prolonged bleeding time (platelet dysfunction)\n- Normal coagulation studies (PT/aPTT)\n- Risk factor: restrictive eating in ballet dancer\n\n**Pathophysiology:**\nVitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a cofactor for **prolyl hydroxylase** and **lysyl hydroxylase**, enzymes that hydroxylate proline and lysine residues in procollagen. This hydroxylation is essential for:\n- Proper collagen cross-linking\n- Collagen stability\n- Blood vessel integrity\n\n**Location of Defect:**\nThe hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in procollagen occurs in the **rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)** during collagen synthesis, before the procollagen is secreted into the extracellular space where it becomes mature collagen.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Rough endoplasmic reticulum\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Classic presentation of scurvy with perifollicular petechiae, gingival bleeding, and hemarthrosis. Vitamin C deficiency impairs hydroxylation of proline/lysine in procollagen, which occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum during collagen synthesis.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
