  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Centrilobular hepatocytes\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"The patient experienced hemorrhagic shock due to massive lower GI bleeding, leading to hypotension and hypoperfusion. The liver is highly susceptible to ischemic injury, particularly the centrilobular (zone 3) hepatocytes, which are furthest from the hepatic artery and portal vein blood supply and thus most vulnerable to hypoxia. The marked elevation in AST and ALT supports acute hepatocellular injury, consistent with ischemic hepatitis (shock liver), which primarily affects centrilobular hepatocytes first.\"}",
