  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this medical question systematically.\n\n**EVIDENCE QUALITY ASSESSMENT**: This is a standard, medically plausible clinical scenario describing a lacunar stroke. The presentation, findings, and diagnostic workup are all consistent with established medical knowledge. Evidence quality: **normal**.\n\n**CLINICAL ANALYSIS**:\n\nKey features:\n- 65-year-old with vascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia)\n- Right-sided numbness (face, arm, leg) - pure sensory syndrome\n- MRI shows 15mm diffusion restriction in LEFT thalamus\n- Blood pressure 165/102 mm Hg (elevated)\n- No motor weakness, normal gait\n- Previous TIA 5 months ago\n\n**DIAGNOSIS**: Lacunar stroke (specifically, pure sensory stroke affecting the thalamus)\n\n**PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF LACUNAR STROKES**:\nLacunar infarcts are small (typically <15mm) deep infarcts caused by occlusion of small penetrating arteries that supply deep brain structures (basal ganglia, thalamus, internal capsule, pons). The primary mechanism is **lipohyalinosis** - a degenerative process affecting small penetrating arteries caused by chronic hypertension and diabetes.\n\n**WHY EACH OPTION**:\n- Option 0 (PFO with DVT emboli): Would cause cortical strokes, not small deep lacunar infarcts\n- Option 1 (Hemorrhage): CT and MRI show infarction, not hemorrhage\n- **Option 2 (Lipohyalinosis)**: CORRECT - This is the classic mechanism for lacunar strokes\n- Option 3 (Carotid stenosis): Causes large vessel territory strokes, not small deep lacunar infarcts\n\nThe student incorrectly chose carotid stenosis, but this patient has a classic lacunar stroke from small vessel disease.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Lipohyalinosis of small penetrating arteries due to chronic hypertension\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"This is a classic",
