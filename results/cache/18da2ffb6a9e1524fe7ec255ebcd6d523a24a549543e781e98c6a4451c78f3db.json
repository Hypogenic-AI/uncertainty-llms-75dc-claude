  "raw_response": "Looking at this study design and potential sources of bias:\n\n**Study Design Analysis:**\n- This is a retrospective case-control study\n- Cases: 200 mothers with ASD-diagnosed children\n- Controls: 200 mothers with healthy children\n- Data collection method: Retrospective interviews about prenatal folic acid consumption\n- Key finding: OR = 0.3 (protective association)\n\n**Evaluating Each Bias:**\n\n1. **Interviewer bias**: Would require systematic differences in how interviewers questioned different groups. The question doesn't suggest interviewers knew case/control status or had differential questioning techniques.\n\n2. **Latency period**: This refers to the time between exposure and disease manifestation. While relevant to study design, it's not a type of bias that would systematically distort results.\n\n3. **Recall bias**: This is the critical issue here. Mothers of children with ASD may recall their prenatal behaviors differently than mothers of healthy children. Specifically:\n   - Mothers with ASD children may search their memories more intensively for potential causes\n   - They may underreport \"protective\" behaviors like folic acid supplementation (feeling guilty they didn't do enough)\n   - Mothers of healthy children may have less motivation for detailed recall\n   - The retrospective nature (up to 4 years later) amplifies this differential recall\n\n4. **Survival bias**: Would apply if some subjects were excluded due to death/loss to follow-up in a way that biases results. Not clearly applicable here.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** The question describes a plausible epidemiological scenario with a real research question. This is methodologically sound.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Recall bias\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"In this retrospective case-control study, mothers are asked to recall prenatal folic acid use years after pregnancy. Mothers of ASD children may recall exposures differently than mothers of healthy children due to their search for explanations, creating systematic recall differences between groups.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
