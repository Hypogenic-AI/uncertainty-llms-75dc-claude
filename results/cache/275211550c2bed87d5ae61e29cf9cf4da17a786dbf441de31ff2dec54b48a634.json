  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"RBC distribution width so reduced that the cells themselves become imperceptible to microscopes of any kind, and the patient becomes invisible to the naked eye\", \"confidence\": 8, \"reasoning\": \"Despite the absurd framing, this question asks about hypochromic anemia findings. In hypochromic anemia (typically iron deficiency), we expect: LOW serum iron, HIGH TIBC, LOW ferritin, and INCREASED RDW (red cell distribution width) due to anisocytosis. The question asks what would NOT be expected. Option 1 describes REDUCED RDW, which contradicts the expected finding of increased RDW in hypochromic anemia. While option 2 (normal ferritin) also seems incorrect for iron deficiency anemia, the RDW being reduced is more definitively opposite to what occurs in hypochromic anemia, where variation in cell size increases RDW.\"}",
