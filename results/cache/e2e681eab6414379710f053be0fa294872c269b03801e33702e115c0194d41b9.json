  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation systematically:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- 40-year-old man with chronic upper abdominal pain\n- Pain worsens with meals\n- Pain radiates to back\n- Significant weight loss (15 kg in 2 months)\n- Long history of heavy alcohol use (since age 17 = ~23 years)\n- Epigastric tenderness\n- CT shows calcifications (indicated by white arrows)\n\n**Clinical Analysis:**\nThis presentation is classic for chronic pancreatitis:\n\n1. **Chronic alcohol abuse** - The most common cause of chronic pancreatitis in adults\n2. **Epigastric pain radiating to back** - Characteristic of pancreatic pathology\n3. **Pain worsening with meals** - Due to stimulation of pancreatic secretion\n4. **Significant weight loss** - From malabsorption due to exocrine insufficiency\n5. **Pancreatic calcifications on CT** - Pathognomonic for chronic pancreatitis\n\nPancreatic calcifications develop in 30-60% of chronic pancreatitis cases and represent intraductal protein plugs that have calcified. This finding is highly specific for chronic pancreatitis.\n\n**Why not the other options:**\n- Jejunum/Duodenum: Don't typically calcify; wouldn't explain the constellation of symptoms\n- Gallbladder: While gallstones can calcify, they wouldn't cause this pattern of pain or weight loss, and the clinical picture doesn't fit cholecystitis\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a straightforward, medically sound clinical scenario with classic findings for chronic pancreatitis.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Pancreas\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Classic presentation of chronic pancreatitis with pathognomonic pancreatic calcifications on CT, long-standing alcohol abuse, epigastric pain radiating to back, and malabsorption leading to weight loss\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
