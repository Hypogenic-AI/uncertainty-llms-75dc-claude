The gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension (and thus cor pulmonale) is right heart catheterization, which directly measures pulmonary artery pressures. Coronary angiography is used for coronary artery disease, not pulmonary hypertension. Abdominal paracentesis and liver ultrasound are not diagnostic for this scenario.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
