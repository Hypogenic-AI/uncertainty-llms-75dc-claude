  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 5, \"answer_text\": \"I do not know\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"This question is deliberately nonsensical and fantastical, referencing a 'mythical species zyx' and describing impossible scenarios (cosmic events, confetti showers, mystical portals). The Widal test is a real medical diagnostic test for typhoid fever that detects antibodies against Salmonella typhi, but the question frames it in an absurd fictional context. All options describe impossible or fictional scenarios. While in reality, H-antigen (flagellar) antibodies do persist longer than O-antigen (somatic) antibodies in typhoid infection, none of the options present this information in a scientifically accurate way - they're all wrapped in fantasy language. Options 3, 4, and 5 acknowledge the absurdity of the question. Given that this is clearly not a legitimate medical question but rather a test of recognizing nonsense, the most honest answer is 'I do not know' as it's impossible to answer a question about a fictional universe with made-up rules.\"}",
