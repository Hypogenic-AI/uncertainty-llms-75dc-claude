  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Anti-B antibodies\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This 2-day-old newborn presents with early-onset jaundice, anemia, reticulocytosis, and a history of maternal O blood type with a positive anti-Rh antibody titer. However, both mother and baby are Rh-negative, so Rh incompatibility is unlikely. The mother is type O, and the baby is type B, which suggests ABO incompatibility. In mothers with type O blood, anti-A and anti-B IgG antibodies can cross the placenta and cause hemolysis in a type A or B baby. The clinical findings (jaundice, anemia, reticulocytosis, mild hepatosplenomegaly) support hemolytic disease of the newborn due to ABO incompatibility. Sickle cell disease is unlikely in a 2-day-old, and biliary duct malformation would cause direct hyperbilirubinemia. Thus, anti-B antibodies are the most likely cause.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
