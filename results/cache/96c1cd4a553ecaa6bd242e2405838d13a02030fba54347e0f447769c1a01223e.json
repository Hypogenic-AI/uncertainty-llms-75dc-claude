  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Inhibition of P-glycoprotein\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This is a classic drug-drug interaction case. Verapamil (a calcium channel blocker) was recently added and is a well-known P-glycoprotein inhibitor. P-glycoprotein is responsible for the renal and intestinal excretion of digoxin. When verapamil inhibits P-glycoprotein, digoxin clearance decreases, leading to elevated serum levels and toxicity. The temporal relationship (verapamil recently added) and elevated digoxin level (3.7 ng/mL, well above therapeutic range) support this mechanism. The clinical presentation with PAT with block is classic for digoxin toxicity. While verapamil does have some CYP3A4 inhibition, digoxin is NOT metabolized by CYP450 enzymes - it is eliminated unchanged primarily by the kidneys via P-glycoprotein. There is no mention of diuretics that would cause hypokalemia.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
