The diagnosis of osteoarthritis is clinical and does not require further work-up in the absence of atypical features (such as signs of infection, acute swelling, or systemic symptoms). Imaging or laboratory studies are not routinely indicated unless the diagnosis is unclear or there are red flag symptoms.\"}",
