  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- 34-year-old man\n- Headaches and blurry vision (4 months)\n- Erectile dysfunction (recent weeks)\n- Bitemporal visual field deficits\n- Intrasellar mass on MRI\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe bitemporal visual field deficits indicate compression of the optic chiasm, which sits directly above the sella turcica. This confirms a pituitary mass with suprasellar extension.\n\nThe erectile dysfunction is the critical clue here. In a young man with a pituitary adenoma, this suggests:\n1. **Hyperprolactinemia** - elevated prolactin suppresses GnRH, leading to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism\n2. This causes decreased testosterone and sexual dysfunction\n\n**Prolactinomas (lactotroph adenomas):**\n- Most common functional pituitary adenoma (~40% of all pituitary adenomas)\n- Most common in young adults (20-40 years)\n- Classic triad: headaches, visual disturbances, hypogonadism\n- In men: erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, infertility\n- Often macroadenomas in men (>1cm) because symptoms are subtle initially\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n- **Thyrotrophs**: Would cause hyperthyroidism (rare, <1% of adenomas)\n- **Somatotrophs**: Would cause acromegaly (enlarged hands/feet, facial changes) - not described\n- **Gonadotrophs**: Usually clinically silent, wouldn't cause erectile dysfunction\n\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Lactotrophs\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Young man with pituitary macroadenoma presenting with erectile dysfunction strongly suggests prolactinoma. Hyperprolactinemia causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in men, leading to sexual dysfunction. Prolactinomas are the most common functional pituitary adenomas and frequently present as macroadenomas in men.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
