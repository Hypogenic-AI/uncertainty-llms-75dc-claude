  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"rectum\", \"confidence\": 8, \"reasoning\": \"When emptying urine (micturition), the internal urethral sphincter relaxes to allow urine flow, but structures need to close to prevent unwanted flow into other areas. The rectum is located posteriorly to the bladder, and the rectovesical pouch (in males) or rectouterine pouch (in females) separates these structures. During urination, the rectum would be the structure most likely to have sphincter closure to prevent any interference. The vas deferens is part of the male reproductive system and doesn't close during urination. The uterus and vagina are female reproductive structures not directly involved in urinary sphincter control. The rectum, with its anal sphincters, is the most appropriate answer for a structure that closes/maintains closure during bladder emptying.\"}",
