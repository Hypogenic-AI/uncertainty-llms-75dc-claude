Importantly, her C-peptide is decreased, which means endogenous insulin secretion is low. In cases of exogenous insulin administration (as in factitious disorder or Munchausen syndrome), C-peptide is low because exogenous insulin suppresses endogenous insulin production. In insulinoma, C-peptide would be elevated due to increased endogenous insulin. Hypothyroidism and somatization disorder do not cause hypoglycemia. The psychosocial stressor (divorce) may be a contributing factor to factitious behavior.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
