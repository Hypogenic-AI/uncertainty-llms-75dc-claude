  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This patient presents with classic signs of congestive heart failure (CHF): exertional dyspnea, orthopnea (using extra pillows), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (nighttime awakenings), bilateral pitting edema, and bibasilar crackles. The long history of heavy alcohol use is a significant risk factor for dilated cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure.\\n\\nIn heart failure, decreased cardiac output leads to:\\n1. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)\\n2. Increased sympathetic nervous system activity\\n3. Release of ADH\\n\\nThese compensatory mechanisms result in:\\n- Increased renal tubular sodium and water reabsorption (to maintain perfusion pressure)\\n- Increased ECF volume (causing edema)\\n- Decreased renal blood flow (due to vasoconstriction)\\n- Eventually decreased GFR in advanced stages\\n\\nThe primary renal response in heart failure is increased sodium reabsorption in the renal tubules, mediated by aldosterone and other neurohormonal factors. This leads to fluid retention and the clinical manifestations of volume overload seen in this patient.\"}",
