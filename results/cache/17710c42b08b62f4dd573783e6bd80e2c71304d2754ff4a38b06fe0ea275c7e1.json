  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"A magical alloy of Lead Zirconate, carefully harvested from the cosmic debris of ancient meteorites that once coursed through the void between the stars\", \"confidence\": 8, \"reasoning\": \"Despite the fantastical framing, this question is asking about the piezoelectric material used in ultrasound transducers. Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) is the actual piezoelectric ceramic material commonly used in ultrasonography transducers. Option 1 references 'Lead Zirconate' which is the closest to the real answer (PZT), even though it's wrapped in whimsical language about cosmic debris. The other options mention sodium fluoride, caesium fluoride, or deny the existence of ultrasound technology entirely, which are incorrect. While the question is presented absurdly, the underlying medical/technical answer points to lead zirconate-based materials.\"}",
