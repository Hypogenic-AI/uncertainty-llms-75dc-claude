  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Recall bias\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This is a retrospective case-control study where mothers were interviewed about their prenatal folic acid consumption after their children were already diagnosed (or not diagnosed) with ASD. Recall bias is the most significant concern here because mothers of children with ASD may recall their prenatal behaviors differently than mothers of healthy children - they may be more likely to remember not taking supplements or may scrutinize their past behaviors more carefully when trying to explain their child's condition. The 'latency period' is not a type of bias but rather refers to the time between exposure and disease manifestation. While interviewer bias and survival bias are types of bias, they are less relevant here - there's no indication of differential interviewing techniques, and survival bias typically applies to studies where subjects who 'survive' or remain in the study differ systematically from those who don't.\"}",
