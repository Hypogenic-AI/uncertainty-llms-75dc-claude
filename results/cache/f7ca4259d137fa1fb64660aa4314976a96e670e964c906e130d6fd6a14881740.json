  "raw_response": "I need to analyze this kidney function study to identify which substance was administered.\n\n**Key Information:**\n- Substance does NOT undergo tubular reabsorption\n- RPF = 600 mL/min\n- We have plasma concentrations and excretion rates at different time points\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me calculate the clearance for each set using: Clearance = Excretion rate / Plasma concentration\n\n- Set 1: 60 / 0.1 = 600 mL/min\n- Set 2: 90 / 0.15 = 600 mL/min\n- Set 3: 104 / 0.2 = 520 mL/min\n- Set 4: 110 / 0.25 = 440 mL/min\n- Set 5: 116 / 0.3 = 387 mL/min\n\n**Key Observation:** At low plasma concentrations (Sets 1-2), clearance = 600 mL/min, which equals the RPF. As plasma concentration increases, clearance decreases.\n\n**Interpretation:**\nThis pattern indicates **tubular secretion that becomes saturated** at higher concentrations. At low concentrations, the substance is completely cleared in one pass (clearance = RPF), but as concentration increases, the secretion mechanism saturates, and clearance falls.\n\n**Evaluating Options:**\n- **Glucose**: Undergoes tubular REABSORPTION (not secretion), violates the stated condition\n- **Para-aminohippurate (PAH)**: Classic substance for measuring RPF; undergoes tubular secretion that can saturate at high concentrations\n- **Cystatin C & Iohexol**: Used to measure GFR (~120 mL/min), freely filtered but not secreted\n\nThe pattern of clearance equaling RPF at low concentrations with saturation at higher concentrations is characteristic of **PAH**.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Para-aminohippurate\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"The clearance equals RPF (600 mL/min) at low concentrations but decreases with saturation",
