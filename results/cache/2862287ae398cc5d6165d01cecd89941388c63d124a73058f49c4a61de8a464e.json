  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Clinical Presentation Analysis:**\n- 5-year-old with \"spacing out\" episodes (absence seizures)\n- 3-Hz spike-and-wave pattern on EEG (pathognomonic for absence epilepsy)\n- Normal development and physical exam\n- No concerning features\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a classic, textbook presentation of childhood absence epilepsy. The scenario is medically sound and evidence-based.\n\n**First-line Treatment:**\nThe first-line medication for childhood absence epilepsy is **ethosuximide**.\n\n**Side Effect Analysis:**\n- **Option 0 (Nystagmus)**: Associated with phenytoin toxicity, not ethosuximide\n- **Option 1 (GI upset)**: Common with ethosuximide (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) - occurs in 30-40% of patients\n- **Option 2 (Facial rash and blood in urine)**: Suggests SLE-like syndrome (seen with hydralazine, procainamide) or severe hypersensitivity - not typical of ethosuximide\n- **Option 3 (Weight gain and hair color change)**: Associated with valproic acid (weight gain, hair thinning/texture changes)\n\nWhile valproic acid is also effective for absence seizures, ethosuximide is preferred as first-line due to better tolerability and lack of serious hepatotoxicity risk in this age group.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"GI upset\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Classic childhood absence epilepsy with 3-Hz spike-wave pattern. First-line treatment is ethosuximide, which commonly causes GI side effects (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain). This is the most frequently reported adverse effect parents should be counseled about.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
