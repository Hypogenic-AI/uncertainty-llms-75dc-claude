The patient's recent onset of bilateral lower extremity edema after starting antihypertensive therapy, with otherwise normal labs, fits this adverse effect. Hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone are diuretics and would be expected to reduce edema, not cause it. Losartan is an ARB and rarely causes edema. The student's answer is incorrect; the correct answer is amlodipine.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
