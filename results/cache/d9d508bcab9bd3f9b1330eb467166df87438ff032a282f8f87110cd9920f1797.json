Cyanide inhibits cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV) in the electron transport chain, not a direct enzyme of the citric acid cycle. None of the options directly refer to cytochrome c oxidase. 'NAO' is likely a typo or misrepresentation; if it is meant to be 'NAD', it is still not correct. Among the options, none are strictly correct, but 'NAO' seems closest if it refers to NAD (which is involved in electron transport), but this is speculative. The evidence quality is suspicious due to unclear options.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"suspicious\"}",
