  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Fallopian tubes\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"The question describes simple cuboidal epithelium, which lines the follicles of the thyroid gland. In the female reproductive tract, the fallopian tubes are lined by simple columnar epithelium (not cuboidal), but the ovaries are covered by a simple cuboidal epithelium (germinal epithelium). However, among the options, the closest match to simple cuboidal epithelium is the ovary, not the fallopian tube. But since the fallopian tube is the only part of the tract with a single layer of cells (though columnar, not cuboidal), and the others (vagina, vulva) are stratified squamous, the best answer based on the options is fallopian tubes, though it's not a perfect match.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
