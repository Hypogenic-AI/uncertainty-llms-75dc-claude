  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Polymerase chain reaction for viral genes\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"This 3-month-old girl presents with failure to thrive, recurrent infections (productive cough, oral thrush, watery stools), lymphadenopathy, and lack of weight gain. She was born at home to a mother with no prenatal care and has not received immunizations. The combination of recurrent infections (including opportunistic infections like oral thrush), lymphadenopathy, and failure to thrive in an infant strongly suggests congenital HIV infection. The best way to confirm HIV infection in an infant is PCR for viral genes, as maternal antibodies can persist for up to 18 months and make serology unreliable. The other options do not fit the clinical picture.\"}",
