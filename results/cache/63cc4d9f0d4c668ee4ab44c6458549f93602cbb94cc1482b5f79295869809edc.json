This parasite invades skeletal muscle and triggers a marked eosinophilic response. Bacterial myositis typically shows neutrophils, viral myositis shows lymphocytes, and autoimmune polymyositis shows lymphocytes and macrophages - not eosinophils. The presence of eosinophils is a key diagnostic clue pointing to parasitic infection.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
