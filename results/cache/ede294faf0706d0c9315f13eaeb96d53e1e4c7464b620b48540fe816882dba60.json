  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 5, \"answer_text\": \"I do not know\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"This question is deliberately absurd and nonsensical. It asks for an 'incomprehensible and utterly nonsensical designation' for a fictional alien species (Zygoons) with specific personality traits. All the provided personality type options (A, B, C, D) are explicitly stated as 'entirely irrelevant to this situation.' The question itself acknowledges it 'defies the very foundations of reason and sanity.' Since this is not a legitimate medical question about actual personality typology, and the question is intentionally designed to be unanswerable within a rational framework, the most honest and appropriate response is 'I do not know' rather than attempting to force-fit an irrelevant answer or pretending the question has logical merit.\"}",
