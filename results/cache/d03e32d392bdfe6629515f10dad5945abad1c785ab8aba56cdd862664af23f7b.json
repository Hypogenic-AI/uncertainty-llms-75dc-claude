  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Class. III malocclusion\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Acromegaly is caused by excess growth hormone, typically from a pituitary adenoma. This leads to overgrowth of bones and soft tissues, particularly in the jaw. The mandible (lower jaw) is especially affected, growing excessively and protruding forward relative to the maxilla (upper jaw). This creates a prognathic appearance and results in Class III malocclusion, where the lower teeth are positioned anterior to the upper teeth. The student's answer of Class II (where upper teeth protrude forward) is the opposite of what occurs in acromegaly.\"}",
