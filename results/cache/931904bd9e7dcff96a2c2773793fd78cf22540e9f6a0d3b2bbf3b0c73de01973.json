  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 5, \"answer_text\": \"I do not know\", \"confidence\": 8, \"reasoning\": \"This question is deliberately constructed with nonsensical and humorous options that misrepresent statistical concepts. The correct interpretation of a 95% CI (125-136 mg/dL) should be: 'We are 95% confident that the true population mean capillary blood glucose lies between 125 and 136 mg/dL.' However, none of the provided options accurately reflect this standard statistical interpretation. Option 0 has an absurd margin of error claim, options 1-3 introduce irrelevant or incorrect conditions (midichlorians, Jedi powers, body side), and option 4 is deliberately absurd. Since none of the options provide a legitimate statistical interpretation of the confidence interval, and this appears to be a trick question testing whether one recognizes that all substantive options are incorrect, the most honest answer is 'I do not know' - acknowledging that no valid interpretation is offered among the choices.\"}",
