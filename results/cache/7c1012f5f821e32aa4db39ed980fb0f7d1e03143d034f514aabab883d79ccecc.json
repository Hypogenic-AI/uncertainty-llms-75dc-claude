  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"End of adolescence or early adulthood.\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Schizophrenia most commonly has its onset in late adolescence or early adulthood, typically between ages 16-30, with peak onset in the early to mid-20s for men and slightly later for women. Childhood-onset schizophrenia (before age 13) is extremely rare.
