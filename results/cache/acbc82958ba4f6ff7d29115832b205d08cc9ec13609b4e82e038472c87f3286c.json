  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation systematically:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- Recent travel to Madagascar (endemic area)\n- Painless red papules on thigh (likely flea bite sites)\n- Severe inguinal lymphadenopathy (bubonic form)\n- Fever and systemic symptoms\n- Gram-negative coccobacilli in lymph node aspirate\n- 4-fold rise in anti-F1 titers (F1 antigen is specific to Yersinia pestis)\n\n**Diagnosis:** This is classic **bubonic plague** caused by *Yersinia pestis*\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:**\n- The clinical presentation is entirely consistent with bubonic plague\n- Madagascar is a well-known endemic area with regular outbreaks\n- The laboratory findings (gram-negative coccobacilli, anti-F1 antibodies) are pathognomonic\n- This is a medically sound, evidence-based question\n\n**Treatment Considerations:**\nThe WHO and CDC recommend aminoglycosides (streptomycin or gentamicin) as first-line treatment for plague. While fluoroquinolones and doxycycline are also effective alternatives, among the options provided:\n\n- **Streptomycin** is the traditional first-line agent for plague\n- Azithromycin has some activity but is not first-line\n- Imipenem is not standard treatment for plague\n- No pharmacotherapy would be inappropriate for this serious, potentially fatal infection\n\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Streptomycin\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Classic presentation of bubonic plague with travel to endemic area, characteristic bubo, gram-negative coccobacilli, and positive F1 serology. Streptomycin is the traditional first-line aminoglycoside for plague treatment per WHO/CDC guidelines.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
