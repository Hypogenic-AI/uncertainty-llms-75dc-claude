  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation systematically:\n\n**Clinical Picture:**\n- 58-year-old woman with tachycardia (140-150/min, irregular)\n- Weight loss despite good appetite\n- Anxiety, insomnia\n- Sweaty palms, fine tremors\n- Palpable smooth thyroid mass\n- Bilateral exophthalmos\n- Irregular pulse\n\n**Diagnosis:** This is classic hyperthyroidism (likely Graves' disease given exophthalmos) with atrial fibrillation.\n\n**Heart Rhythm:** The irregular pulse at 140-150/min with an ECG mentioned strongly suggests atrial fibrillation (AF).\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\n1. **Digoxin blood level** - Used to treat AF but doesn't correlate with AF occurrence\n2. **PR interval** - Not applicable in AF (no consistent P waves)\n3. **Age** - STRONG positive correlation with AF prevalence:\n   - <50 years: ~0.5% prevalence\n   - 60-70 years: ~5% prevalence  \n   - >80 years: ~10-15% prevalence\n   - Age is one of the most robust risk factors for AF\n4. **Amiodarone blood level** - Treatment for AF, not a risk factor\n\nWhile hyperthyroidism is the acute precipitant here, the question asks what has a \"strong positive correlation\" with the heart rhythm itself. Age is the most well-established epidemiological risk factor that positively correlates with atrial fibrillation across all populations.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Age\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Patient has atrial fibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism. Age is the strongest independent risk factor with positive correlation to AF prevalence, increasing exponentially with each decade of life. This is well-established in cardiovascular epidemiology.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
