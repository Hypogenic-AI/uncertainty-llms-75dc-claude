The need for atrial septostomy suggests a condition where mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood is critical for survival. These findings are classic for transposition of the great vessels (TGA), where the aorta and pulmonary artery are switched, leading to parallel rather than series circulation. The 'egg-on-a-string' or 'egg-shaped' heart is a classic radiographic sign of TGA. The other options do not fit the clinical and radiographic findings as closely.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
