  "raw_response": "Let me assess this question carefully.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This question appears to have significant issues:\n1. The phrasing \"close above the bladder\" is anatomically unclear\n2. The question seems to be asking about urinary sphincter function, but the options don't include relevant anatomical structures (internal/external urethral sphincters)\n3. None of the listed options actually \"close\" during urination\n4. The options include reproductive and digestive structures that don't have a closing mechanism related to bladder emptying\n\n**Analysis of the Question:**\nDuring urination (micturition), the internal urethral sphincter (located at the bladder neck) relaxes to allow urine flow. The question seems poorly constructed, as:\n- Uterus: doesn't close during urination\n- Vaginal: not a sphincter or closing structure\n- Rectum: the anal sphincters are separate from urinary function\n- Vas deferens: a sperm duct, not involved in urination control\n\n**However**, if interpreting \"close above the bladder\" as asking what structure might contract/close at the bladder neck level during urination in males, the vas deferens does have smooth muscle and passes near the bladder neck, but it doesn't \"close\" during urination.\n\nThis question appears to be poorly translated or constructed with anatomically implausible options.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Vas deferens\", \"confidence\": 2, \"reasoning\": \"This question is poorly constructed with anatomically inappropriate options. None of these structures actually 'close above the bladder' during urination. If forced to choose, vas deferens is the only option with any anatomical proximity to the bladder neck in males, though this is still medically inaccurate.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"suspicious\"}\n```",
