  "raw_response": "Looking at this question about diagnosing a thyroid nodule in a 29-year-old woman, I need to identify which statement is an ERROR (incorrect) in the diagnostic approach.\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\n**Option 0: \"Due time of occurrence and symptoms, family history information\"**\n- Taking a thorough history (timing, symptoms, family history) is CORRECT and essential for thyroid nodule evaluation\n\n**Option 1: \"Do ultrasound and FNA (fine needle aspiration cytology)\"**\n- Ultrasound is the first-line imaging for thyroid nodules (CORRECT)\n- FNA is indicated for nodules meeting certain criteria (CORRECT)\n\n**Option 2: \"Do check TSH\"**\n- TSH measurement is CORRECT and recommended in initial evaluation of all thyroid nodules to assess thyroid function\n\n**Option 3: \"CT and MRI do\"**\n- CT and MRI are NOT routinely recommended for initial thyroid nodule evaluation\n- They are reserved for specific situations (substernal extension, suspected invasion, staging malignancy)\n- Routine use would be inappropriate and unnecessary (ERROR)\n\nThe student answered \"Do check TSH\" which is actually a CORRECT step in thyroid nodule evaluation, so the student was wrong.\n\nThe CORRECT answer to \"which is an ERROR\" is **Option 3** (CT and MRI), as these are not part of routine initial diagnostic workup.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"CT and MRI do\", \"confidence\": 8, \"reasoning\": \"CT and MRI are not routinely indicated for initial thyroid nodule evaluation. Standard workup includes history, TSH, ultrasound, and FNA when indicated. Advanced imaging is reserved for specific situations like substernal extension or suspected invasion.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}\n```",
