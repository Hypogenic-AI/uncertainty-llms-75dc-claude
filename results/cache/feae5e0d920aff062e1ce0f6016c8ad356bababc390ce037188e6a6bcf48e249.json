The key findings are anemia (likely due to vitamin B12 deficiency from intrinsic factor loss), increased serum gastrin (due to loss of acid-producing parietal cells leading to feedback hypergastrinemia), and inflammation of the gastric body and fundus (where parietal cells reside). The most likely cause is parietal cell destruction.\"}",
