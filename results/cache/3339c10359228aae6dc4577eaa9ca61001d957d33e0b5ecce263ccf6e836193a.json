  "raw_response": "Looking at this case systematically:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- 3-month-old infant with:\n  - Productive cough (5 days)\n  - Recurrent watery diarrhea (1 month)\n  - Failure to thrive (5th percentile for height and weight)\n  - Fever (38.5\u00b0C)\n  - Oral thrush (white plaques on tongue/palate)\n  - Bilateral rales (pneumonia)\n  - Generalized lymphadenopathy (cervical and inguinal)\n  - No prenatal care, home delivery, no immunizations\n\n**Differential Analysis:**\n\n1. **Karyotyping** - Would be for chromosomal disorders, but doesn't explain the acute infectious picture with fever, pneumonia, and thrush\n\n2. **CFTR mutation testing** - Cystic fibrosis can cause failure to thrive and recurrent respiratory infections, but:\n   - Doesn't typically cause generalized lymphadenopathy\n   - Doesn't explain oral thrush\n   - Doesn't explain the constellation of opportunistic infections\n\n3. **FTA-ABS test** - For congenital syphilis, but:\n   - Doesn't typically present with thrush and pneumonia at 3 months\n   - Pattern doesn't fit\n\n4. **PCR for viral genes** - This infant has:\n   - Multiple opportunistic infections (oral candidiasis, likely *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia given bilateral rales)\n   - Failure to thrive\n   - Generalized lymphadenopathy\n   - No prenatal care (mother's HIV status unknown)\n   - Classic presentation of **HIV infection in infancy**\n\nThe combination of opportunistic infections (thrush + pneumonia), failure to thrive, and lymphadenopathy in an infant with no prenatal care strongly suggests vertical HIV transmission. PCR for HIV viral genes (HIV DNA or RNA PCR) is the diagnostic test of choice in infants <18 months.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Polymerase chain reaction for viral genes\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"The",
