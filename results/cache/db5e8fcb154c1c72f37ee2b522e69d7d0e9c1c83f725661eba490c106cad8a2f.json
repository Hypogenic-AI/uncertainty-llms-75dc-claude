  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation systematically:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- Extreme cyanosis immediately after birth\n- Progressive respiratory failure\n- Single loud S2\n- Machine-like murmur at left upper sternal border\n- \"Egg-shaped\" heart on radiography\n- Atrial septostomy performed as temporizing measure\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe combination of severe cyanosis at birth with a single loud S2 and egg-shaped heart is classic for **Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA)**.\n\n**Why TGA fits:**\n- **Severe cyanosis at birth**: TGA creates parallel circulations - deoxygenated blood recirculates through the body, oxygenated blood through the lungs. Survival requires mixing (PDA, ASD, VSD)\n- **Single loud S2**: The anteriorly positioned aorta makes A2 louder and masks P2\n- **Egg-shaped heart**: Classic \"egg on a string\" appearance due to narrow mediastinum (parallel great vessels) and RV hypertrophy\n- **Atrial septostomy (Rashkind procedure)**: This is THE classic emergency intervention for TGA to improve mixing at the atrial level until definitive arterial switch surgery\n- **Machine-like murmur**: Likely from PDA, which provides crucial mixing\n\n**Why not the others:**\n- **Coarctation**: Presents with differential cyanosis/pulses, not immediate severe cyanosis\n- **Truncus arteriosus**: Single S2 fits, but presents with CHF more than cyanosis, no egg-shaped heart\n- **Tricuspid atresia**: Cyanotic but doesn't have the egg-shaped heart or require atrial septostomy (already has obligate ASD)\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Transposition of great vessels\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Classic presentation of TGA with immediate severe cyanosis, single loud S2, egg-shaped heart on X-ray, and atrial septostomy as emergency intervention. All findings are pathognomonic for this condition.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}\n```",
