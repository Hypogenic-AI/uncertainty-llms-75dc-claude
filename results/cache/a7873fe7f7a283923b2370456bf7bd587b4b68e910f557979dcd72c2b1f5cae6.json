  "raw_response": "Looking at this clinical presentation, I need to identify the syndrome and appropriate treatment.\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- Gait disturbance (broad-based, slow, short steps) - progressive over 1 year\n- Urinary incontinence (urgency, now requiring adult diapers) - progressive over 6 months\n- Cognitive decline (impaired attention/concentration, disorientation to time, memory impairment, decreased driving ability)\n- Multiple falls\n- No focal neurological findings\n\n**Analysis:**\nThis is the classic triad of **Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH)**:\n1. **Gait apraxia** (magnetic gait - broad-based, shuffling)\n2. **Urinary incontinence** (urgency type)\n3. **Cognitive impairment** (subcortical dementia pattern)\n\nThe mnemonic is \"Wet, Wacky, Wobbly\" - appearing in this typical order.\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a straightforward, medically plausible clinical scenario with classic NPH presentation. No red flags or implausible elements.\n\n**Treatment Options Analysis:**\n- **Ventricular shunting**: Gold standard for NPH - ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt to drain excess CSF\n- **Acetazolamide**: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, sometimes used for idiopathic intracranial hypertension or pseudotumor cerebri (not NPH)\n- **Temporal lobectomy**: Surgical treatment for refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (not relevant)\n- **Donepezil**: Cholinesterase inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease (not effective for NPH)\n\nNPH is one of the few reversible causes of dementia, and ventricular shunting can significantly improve symptoms, particularly gait disturbance.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Ventricular shunting\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"Classic triad of NPH (gait apraxia, urinary incontinence, cognitive decline) with no focal findings.
