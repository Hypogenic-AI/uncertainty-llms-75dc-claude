They can undergo intramolecular esterification to form cyclic esters, which are called lactones. The student's answer 'Amides' is incorrect, as amides result from reactions between carboxylic acids and amines, not from esterification. The other options (ethers, nitriles) are not products of hydroxy acid esterification.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
