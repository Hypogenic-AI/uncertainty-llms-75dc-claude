  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Cell injury due to drug metabolites\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"This patient developed a photosensitive rash after sun exposure while taking demeclocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic known to cause phototoxic reactions. Phototoxicity is due to direct cell injury from reactive drug metabolites formed in the skin upon exposure to ultraviolet light. The distribution of the rash on sun-exposed areas and the timing after sun exposure strongly support this mechanism. The other options do not fit the clinical scenario: mast cell degranulation would cause urticaria, drug-induced autoantibodies would cause a delayed, systemic reaction, and porphobilinogen accumulation is associated with porphyrias, which have a different presentation.\"}",
