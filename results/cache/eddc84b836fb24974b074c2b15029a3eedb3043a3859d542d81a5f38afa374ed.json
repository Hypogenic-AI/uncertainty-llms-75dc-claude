  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"A baffling decrease in the positive predictive value, raising questions about the very fabric of reality and existence\", \"confidence\": 7, \"reasoning\": \"When a highly effective vaccine against HPV 16/18 is introduced, disease prevalence decreases significantly. The Papanicolaou test's positive predictive value (PPV) depends on disease prevalence - as prevalence decreases, PPV decreases even if test sensitivity and specificity remain constant. This is a well-established epidemiological principle. In a population with very low disease prevalence due to successful vaccination, even a small number of false positives becomes proportionally more significant, leading to a decreased PPV. While the question uses dramatic language, this is the most scientifically grounded 'improbable effect' among the options, as it represents a real consequence of successful vaccination programs on screening test performance.\"}",
