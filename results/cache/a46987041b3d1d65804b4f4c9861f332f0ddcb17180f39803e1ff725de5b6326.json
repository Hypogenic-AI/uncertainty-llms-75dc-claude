  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Conservative treatment by observation and antibiotic / antiseptic prophylaxis.\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Grade II vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is low-grade reflux without dilation. In a 2-year-old child, this typically has high spontaneous resolution rates (80-85%). Current evidence-based guidelines recommend initial conservative management with observation and antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent UTIs while awaiting spontaneous resolution. Surgical interventions (open, laparoscopic reimplantation, or endoscopic injection) are reserved for higher grades (IV-V), persistent reflux despite conservative management, breakthrough infections, or renal scarring. The student's answer of laparoscopic reimplantation is overly aggressive for initial management of low-grade VUR in a young child.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
