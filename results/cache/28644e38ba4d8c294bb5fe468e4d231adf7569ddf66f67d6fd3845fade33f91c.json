  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"Cast metal\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"When both the mesiobuccal and distobuccal cusps of a mandibular first molar are involved, there is significant loss of tooth structure and cusp support. The restoration of choice in such cases is a cast metal restoration (such as a cast metal crown or onlay), as it provides the necessary strength and durability to withstand occlusal forces. Composite and GIC are not strong enough for such extensive cusp replacement, and intermediate restoration is only a temporary solution.\"}",
