During acute infection, the immune response (IgM and IgG) is primarily directed against phase II antigens. Chronic infection is associated with antibodies against phase I antigens. The other options are incorrect: phase change is not due to flagellum gene mutation, phase I has complete O-antigen sugars, and phase II bacteria do not inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion.\"}",
