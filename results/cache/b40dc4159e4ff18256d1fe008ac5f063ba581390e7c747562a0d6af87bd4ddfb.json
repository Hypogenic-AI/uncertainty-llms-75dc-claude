  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 0, \"answer_text\": \"Sofosbuvir and simeprevir\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"This patient has chronic hepatitis C infection, as evidenced by positive HCV IgG and a high HCV RNA viral load. The current standard of care for chronic hepatitis C is direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) such as sofosbuvir and simeprevir, which are highly effective and well-tolerated. Interferon-gamma is not used for hepatitis C; ribavirin is sometimes used in combination but not as monotherapy; lamivudine is used for hepatitis B, not C. Therefore, the best choice is sofosbuvir and simeprevir.\"}",
