A LOW Vd indicates the drug is primarily confined to the plasma/vascular compartment and does NOT extensively distribute into tissues. Vd is independent of half-life, bioavailability, and efficacy. The student confused Vd with half-life, which are separate parameters.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}",
