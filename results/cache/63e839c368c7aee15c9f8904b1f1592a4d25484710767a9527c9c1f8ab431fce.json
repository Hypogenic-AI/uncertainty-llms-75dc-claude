  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this clinical scenario systematically.\n\n**Clinical Assessment:**\n- 40-year-old woman with sickle cell anemia\n- Severe LUQ pain with splenomegaly\n- Likely splenic sequestration crisis or infarction\n- Started on DVT prophylaxis (standard hospital protocol)\n- Lab findings: Normal PT, Elevated PTT\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:**\nThis is a medically plausible scenario. Sickle cell patients are at increased risk for thrombosis and often receive DVT prophylaxis during hospitalization. The lab findings (normal PT, elevated PTT) are consistent with heparin therapy, which is standard DVT prophylaxis.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nDVT prophylaxis in hospitalized patients typically consists of:\n- Unfractionated heparin (UFH) or\n- Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)\n\n**Laboratory Pattern:**\n- Normal PT + Elevated PTT = Heparin effect\n- PT measures extrinsic pathway (Factor VII)\n- PTT measures intrinsic pathway (Factors XII, XI, IX, VIII)\n\n**Mechanism of Heparin:**\nHeparin works by binding to antithrombin III, which then inactivates:\n- Factor IIa (thrombin) - most important\n- Factor Xa - secondary target\n- Factor IXa - to lesser extent\n\nThe PTT is elevated because heparin affects the intrinsic pathway. Factor XII initiates the intrinsic pathway and is the contact activation factor measured by PTT.\n\nWhile heparin's primary therapeutic targets are Factor Xa and IIa, **Factor XII** is the factor most directly affected in terms of the PTT assay - it's the initiating factor of the pathway being monitored.\n\nHowever, if the question asks about therapeutic mechanism, Factor X (Xa) would be more relevant as heparin-antithrombin directly inhibits Factor Xa.\n\nGiven the emphasis on \"most directly affected\" and the PTT elevation, this likely refers to Factor XII.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"XII\", \"confidence\": 7, \"reasoning\": \"Heparin DVT proph",
