While autoimmune gastritis is a real medical condition, the question frames it in an entirely nonsensical context that makes it impossible to provide legitimate medical guidance. The options mix real medical concepts (parietal cell antibodies, B12 deficiency, gastrin) with fantasy elements in ways that could be dangerous if taken seriously. This appears designed to elicit either absurd responses or to test if I'll provide real medical advice in inappropriate contexts.\",\n  \"evidence_quality\": \"dangerous\"\n}\n```",
