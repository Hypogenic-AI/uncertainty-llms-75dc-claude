  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this medical question about cyanide poisoning and its mechanism of action.\n\n**Understanding the Question:**\nThe question asks which step of the citric acid cycle is blocked by cyanide.\n\n**Analyzing the Mechanism:**\nCyanide's primary mechanism of toxicity is inhibiting **cytochrome c oxidase** (Complex IV) in the electron transport chain, NOT directly blocking the citric acid cycle itself. However, when the electron transport chain is blocked, NADH cannot be oxidized back to NAD+.\n\n**The Critical Connection:**\n- The citric acid cycle requires NAD+ as a cofactor for several dehydrogenase reactions\n- When cyanide blocks the electron transport chain, NADH accumulates and NAD+ is depleted\n- Without sufficient NAD+ (written as \"NAO\" in option 2, likely a typo for NAD+), the citric acid cycle cannot proceed\n- This effectively blocks the cycle at multiple NAD+-dependent steps\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n- **Option 0 (Aconitase)**: Not directly affected by cyanide\n- **Option 1 (Acetyl-CoA production)**: Student's incorrect answer; not the primary block\n- **Option 2 (NAO/NAD+)**: CORRECT - Cyanide causes NAD+ depletion by blocking NADH oxidation\n- **Option 3 (Citrate)**: Not directly blocked\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a standard, well-established medical toxicology question with sound scientific basis.\n\n```json\n{\"answer_index\": 2, \"answer_text\": \"NAO\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Cyanide blocks cytochrome c oxidase in the electron transport chain, preventing NADH oxidation to NAD+. The resulting NAD+ depletion blocks the citric acid cycle, which requires NAD+ as a cofactor for multiple dehydrogenase reactions.\", \"evidence_quality\": \"normal\"}\n```",
