  "raw_response": "{\"answer_index\": 3, \"answer_text\": \"Corynebacterium diphtheriae\", \"confidence\": 10, \"reasoning\": \"The key diagnostic features described are: 1) Growth on specialized medium containing sheep blood, cystine, and potassium tellurite, 2) Black colonies with shining surface, 3) Respiratory disease outbreak in children. This describes Loeffler's medium or tellurite agar, which is selective for Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The black colonies result from tellurite reduction by C. diphtheriae. Legionella requires buffered charcoal yeast extract agar, Haemophilus requires chocolate agar with X and V factors, and Bordetella requires Bordet-Gengou or Regan-Lowe medium. The combination of tellurite medium producing black colonies is pathognomonic for C. diphtheriae.\"}",
