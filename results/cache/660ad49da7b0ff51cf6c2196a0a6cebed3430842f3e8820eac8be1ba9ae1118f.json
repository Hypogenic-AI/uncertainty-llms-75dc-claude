  "raw_response": "Let me analyze this clinical case systematically.\n\n**Key Clinical Findings:**\n- 35-year-old female with hypoglycemia (glucose 35 mg/dL)\n- Normal HbA1c (5.1%) - indicates no chronic hyperglycemia\n- **Decreased C-peptide** - this is the critical finding\n- No prior episodes\n- Psychosocial stress (difficult divorce)\n- Family history of diabetes (likely not relevant here)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nC-peptide is produced when the pancreas makes insulin. The interpretation of C-peptide levels in hypoglycemia:\n- **Low C-peptide + hypoglycemia = exogenous insulin administration**\n- High C-peptide + hypoglycemia = endogenous insulin overproduction (insulinoma, sulfonylurea use)\n\n**Evaluating Options:**\n\n1. **Insulinoma**: Would cause HIGH C-peptide (endogenous insulin production). This contradicts the decreased C-peptide finding. \u274c\n\n2. **Factitious disorder**: Patient secretly administering exogenous insulin would cause:\n   - Hypoglycemia \u2713\n   - LOW C-peptide \u2713 (exogenous insulin suppresses endogenous production)\n   - Normal HbA1c \u2713\n   - Psychosocial stressor present (divorce) - common context \u2713\n\n3. **Hypothyroidism**: Does not typically cause acute severe hypoglycemia with low C-peptide. \u274c\n\n4. **Somatization disorder**: Involves physical symptoms from psychological distress, but doesn't explain the objective biochemical findings. \u274c\n\n**Evidence Quality Assessment:** This is a medically plausible case with internally consistent findings typical of factitious hypoglycemia.\n\n{\"answer_index\": 1, \"answer_text\": \"Factitious disorder\", \"confidence\": 9, \"reasoning\": \"Low C-peptide with hypoglycemia indicates exogenous insulin administration rather than endogenous overproduction. Normal HbA1c rules out diabetes. The combination of biochemical findings (low glucose + low C-peptide) with psychosocial stress strongly suggests fact",
