Project: Uncertainty-Aware Medical LLMs: Quantifying Doubt in the Face of Counterfactuals

Summary:
- 25 papers downloaded to papers/
- 7 papers deep-read with detailed summaries
- 9 tier-1 datasets downloaded to datasets/downloaded/
- 8 code repositories cloned to code/
- literature_review.md written (203 lines, ~3800 words)
- resources.md written (224 lines, comprehensive catalog)

Papers (25):
  Core UE methods: semantic entropy, word-sequence entropy, conformal prediction, self-verification
  Medical: MedFuzz, Med-HALT, MedHallu, uncertainty in medical QA
  Counterfactual: AFICE (sycophancy resistance), uncertainty fragility
  Methodology: calibration surveys, verbalized confidence, internal states

Datasets downloaded (9 tier-1):
  medqa, pubmedqa_labeled, pubmedqa_artificial, medmcqa
  medhallu_labeled, medhallu_artificial
  medhalt_reasoning_fct, medhalt_reasoning_nota, medhalt_reasoning_fake

Code repositories cloned (8):
  lm-polygraph, semantic_uncertainty, semantic-entropy-probes
  Conformal-Uncertainty-Criterion, afice, medhalt, MedHallu
  LLM-Uncertainty-Bench

Key finding / Research gap:
  No existing work combines uncertainty estimation methods (semantic entropy,
  conformal prediction, WSE) with counterfactual/adversarial perturbation testing
  (MedFuzz-style) in the medical domain. This is the novel contribution.
